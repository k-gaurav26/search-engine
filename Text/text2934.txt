Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a tree (connected, undirected, acyclic graph) consisting of N nodes. Based on this tree, you have to answer Q queries.
Each query is of the form:

K D V1​ V2​ ⋯ VK​ - output the number of pairs (i,j), 1≤i<j≤K, such that the shortest path between nodes Vi​ and Vj​ in the tree has D edges.

Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers, N and Q.
N−1 lines follow. Each line consists of two integers u and v, indicating that there is an edge between nodes u and v in the tree.
Q lines follow. Each line describes a query in the format given above.

Output
For each query, output the answer on a new line.
