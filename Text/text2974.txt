Chef and N animals (numbered 1 through N) must cross a river. They are all currently located at the left bank; Chef wants all animals and himself to be located at the right bank at the end. Some of the animals do not get along with each other, so they must not be left unattended by Chef at the same bank at any point in time.
These restrictions are described by a tree with N vertices; an edge between vertices u and v denotes that animals u and v do not get along with each other.
There is just a single boat with which Chef and the animals can cross the river. When the boat is crossing the river, Chef must be in the boat to steer it, possibly with zero or more animals; meanwhile, all animals that are not in the boat are left unattended.
The capacity of the boat is the maximum number of animals that can fit into the boat when crossing the river, plus 1 (for Chef).
Initially, the tree consists only of vertex 1 (the root); the vertices 2,3,…,N are added to the tree one by one in this order. Whenever a vertex is added, it is connected to exactly one of the vertices already present in the tree (its parent). After adding each vertex, you should compute the minimum required capacity of the boat such that it is possible for Chef and the animals to move to the right bank of the river.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N−1 space-separated integers p2​,p3​,…,pN​, where pi​ denotes the parent of vertex i.

Output
Print a single line containing N−1 space-separated integers; for each i (1≤i≤N−1), the i-th of these integers should denote the minimum capacity of the boat after adding vertex i+1.
