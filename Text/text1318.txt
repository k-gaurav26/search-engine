Misha calls a non-empty set of positive integers nice if it has the following properties:

Each element of the set is between l and r (inclusive).
The greatest positive integer which divides each element of the set is exactly g.

Misha likes nice sets, so she wants to find the size of the largest nice set. Help her solve the problem.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers l, r and g.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of elements in a nice set, or 0 if no nice set exists.
