Problem
Given an array A of length N such that 1≤Ai​≤N and Ai​=i, ∀i∈[1,N].
Count the number of arrays B of length N such that ∀i∈[1,N]:

Bi​=BAi​​
1≤Bi​≤M

Since the answer may be large, print it modulo 109+7.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains 2 lines of input:

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.



Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer on a newline - answer modulo 109+7.
