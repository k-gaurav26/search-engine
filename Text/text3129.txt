Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given two integers N and M. You have to construct a matrix with N rows and M columns. Consider a multiset S which contains N+M integers: for each row and each column of this matrix, the MEX of the elements of this row/column belongs to S. Then, in the matrix you construct, the MEX of S must be maximum possible.
Note: The MEX of a multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in this multiset. For example, MEX({4,9,0,1,1,5})=2 and MEX({1,2,3})=0.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.

Output
For each test case, print N lines. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines should contain M space-separated integers ― the elements in the i-th row of your matrix. Each element of the matrix must be non-negative and must not exceed 109.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
