Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  , Russian and Vietnamese
You are given a string S, made of lowercase Latin letters.
You are also given a wildcard string T, containing lowercase latin letters and asterisks (symbol *).
Both the strings are 1-indexed.
Wildcard string T is said to generate a string P if and only if P can be obtained from T by replacing all the asterisks with arbitrary (possibly empty) lowercase Latin letter strings.
Consider the ith symbol of the string S. Let's calculate the smallest index pi â‰¥ i such that the substring Si...Spi contains at least one of the strings generated by wildcard string T. In case any such index pi doesn't exist, then pi = -1.
Your goal is to calculate all the values p1, p2, ... , p|S|.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer Tn denoting the number of test cases. The description of Tn test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a wildcard string T.
The second line of the test case contains a lowercase Latin string S.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing |S| space-separated integers, denoting p1, p2, ..., p|S|.
