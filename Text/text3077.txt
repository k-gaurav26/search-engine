Joshua is hiding a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​, where N is even. He wants to play a game with you. Your goal is to guess the sequence.
First, Joshua tells you A1​ and AN​. Then, you should ask him queries. In each query, you choose four integers L1​, R1​, L2​ and R2​ such that 1≤L1​<R1​≤N and 1≤L2​<R2​≤N, and Joshua's answer is the maximum of AL1​​,AL1​+1​,…,AR1​​ minus the minimum of AL2​​,AL2​+1​,…,AR2​​.
Can you find the sequence using no more than 2N queries?
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing three space-separated integers N, A1​ and AN​.
Then you may ask queries. To ask a query:

Print a line containing the character 'Q' followed by a space and four space-separated integers L1​, R1​, L2​ and R2​.
Then, read a line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.


When you think you know the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!' followed by a space and N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ describing your guess.

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
