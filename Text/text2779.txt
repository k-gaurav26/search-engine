Problem
Nayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random arrays as birthday presents, but this time she received random arrays as presents for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with the array, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her the following problem.
Given 3 integers N,P, and M.

Let f(A) be the MEX of the array A.
Let g(A)=(f(A))P for the array A .

There are (M+1)N distinct arrays A=[A1​,A2​,…,AN​] such that (0≤Ai​≤M) ∀ (1≤i≤N).
Calculate the sum of g(A) over all such (M+1)N arrays. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 754974721.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, three integers N,P, and M.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the value of the given sum modulo 754974721.
