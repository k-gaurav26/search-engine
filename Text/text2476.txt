Problem
Chef has a sequence of N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. He defines a function f(i,j) as follows:
f(i,j)=Ai​+max(Ai​,Ai+1​)+max(Ai​,Ai+1​,Ai+2​)+⋯+max(Ai​,Ai+1​,…,Aj​)
Chef tries to find the sum of f(i,j) over all (i,j) such that 1≤i≤j≤N (i.ei=1∑n​j=i∑n​f(i,j)), but fails. Can you help him find the sum?
Since the sum can be very large, find it modulo (109+7).
Note: Since the size of the input and output is large, please use fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the required sum i.e i=1∑n​j=i∑n​f(i,j) modulo (109+7).
