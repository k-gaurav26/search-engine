Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.
You are given a rooted tree with N nodes. You would like to paint each node of the tree in one of three possible colors: red, green, and blue. The following conditions must be fulfilled:


For each node painted red, there must be no more than R red nodes in its subtree (including this node).


For each node painted green, there must be no more than G green nodes in its subtree (including this node).


For each node painted blue, there must be no more than B blue nodes in it's subtree (including this node).





Find the number of ways to paint the tree and output it modulo 1000000007.

Input
The first line contains four integers N, R, G and B. 
The following N-1 lines contain pairs of the nodes' numbers Ui and Vi (one pair per line), describing the edges of the tree.

The nodes are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive, and the node with the index 1 is the root of the tree.

Output
Output the answer to the problem on the first line.
