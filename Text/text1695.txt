Problem
You are given Chef's calendar for the next N days, defined as a binary string S of length N where Si​=0 means that Chef has a holiday on the ith day from now, and Si​=1 means that Chef has to work on that day.
Chef wants to plan his vacations. For each vacation, Chef needs X consecutive holidays in his calendar. Obviously, he can only go on one vacation at a time.
Chef can take at most one extra holiday. That is, he can flip at most one digit in S from 1 to 0. If he does this optimally, what is the maximum number of vacations that he can go on?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N — Chef's schedule.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer — the maximum number of vacations Chef can take if he takes at most one more extra holiday.
