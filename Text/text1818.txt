Problem
Chef has given you a sequence A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] composed of N nonnegative integer numbers. Then, for each pair (i; j) such that 1 <= i < j <= N, we have written a number that equals to A[i] xor A[j] (xor is exclusive or, "xor" in Pascal, "^" in C++). Thus, we have obtained N*(N-1)/2 numbers. Your task is to find K minimal numbers among them.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N and K. Each of the next N lines contains one integer, ith line contains number A[i].
Output
In the only line of output print space separated sequence of  K numbers, the answer to the problem. Numbers should be in non-decreasing order.
