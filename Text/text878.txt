Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarian Chinise.
Let A be a set of the first N positive integers :A={1,2,3,4.........N} Let B be the set containing all the subsets of A. 
Let A be a set of the first N positive integers :A={1,2,3,4.........N} Let B be the set containing all the subsets of A. 
Professor Eric is a mathematician who defined two kind of relations R1 and R2 on set B. The relations are defined as follows: R1={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B and x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x and the intersection of x and y is equal to empty set } R2={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B and x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x and the intersection of x and y is not equal to empty set } 
Now given the number N,Professor Eric wants to know how many relations of kind R1 and R2 exists.Help him. NOTE : (x,y) is the same as (y,x) ,i.e the pairs are unordered.
Input format:
The first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the test case is denoted by a single integer N.
Output format:
Output T lines, one for each test case,containing two integers denoting the number of relations of kind R1 and R2 respectively, modulo 100000007.
