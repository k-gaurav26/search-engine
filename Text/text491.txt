One day, Chef's friend gave him a wrong number W containing N+1 digits and said that the actual number A is the largest possible number that can be obtained from deleting exactly one digit of W. Chef was able to find A but forgot W.
Given A, find the smallest possible number W of length N+1 without leading 0's that is consistent with the story above. We can show that there is always at least one such W consistent with the story.
