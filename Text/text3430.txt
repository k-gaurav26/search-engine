Problem
You are given N nonnegative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. Determine if there exist nonnegative integers B,C such that the following condition holds:
(A1​+B)⊕C<(A2​+B)⊕C<…<(AN​+B)⊕C
Here ⊕ denotes the XOR operation (bitwise exclusive OR).
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the number of integers.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, if such integers exist, output YES. Otherwise, output NO.
You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yeS, YeS, and yEs will all be treated as identical).
