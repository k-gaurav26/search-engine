Problem
Tyrion is learning game theory to impress the queen.Lord Varys wanted to test the learning of Tyrion so he presented him with a problem on min-max. Help Tyrion in solving the problem.
Given a tree with N nodes rooted at node 1. Each node (U) of the tree is associated with a pair of values (AU​,BU​). You need to find the value of result (R).
R=U=1∑N​V=1∑N​F(U,V)
F(U,V)={MIN(MAX(AU​,AV​),MAX(BU​,BV​))0​ifVliesinsubtreeofUotherwise​
Input:

First line will contain one integer N denoting number of nodes in the tree.
Second line will contain N space separated integers A1​,A2​,A3​......AN​.
Third line will contain N space separated integers B1​,B2​,B3​......BN​.
Each of the next N−1 lines will contain 2 space separated integers U and V denoting that there is an edge between node U and V.

Output:
Output in a single line value of result R.
