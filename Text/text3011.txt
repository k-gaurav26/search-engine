Problem
You are shopping in a store that has n magical stones. For each stone, there is a probability g that you will put it in your bag. The value g is the same for all stones, all stones are independent, and you are given the value of g modulo 998 244 353.
Suppose when you checkout, you have r stones in your bag. Then you will be charged a price of (ar+b)k magical coins, where a,b,k are constants. What is the expected value of the price you will pay, for all 1≤k≤kmax​? Find the expected values modulo 998 244 353.
Input

The first line contains five integers n, kmax​, a, b, g

Output

For all 1≤k≤kmax​, print the expected value of the price modulo 998 244 353.
