Problem
Sarthak has a set S of N distinct prime numbers. He grew very fond of that set, and now he only likes a positive integer X if all of its prime factors belong to S. Given the set and a positive integer M, can you find out how many integers he likes which are not more than M?
Note: Sarthak always like the number 1.
Input Format

The first line of each input contains T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M - the size of S and the limit defined in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers S1​,S2​,…,SN​ - the elements of S.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of positive integers Sarthak likes that is not more than M.
