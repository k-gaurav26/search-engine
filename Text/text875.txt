Problem
JJ gives Chef a number X and challenges Chef to come up with three distinct numbers A, B, and C such that:

0≤A,B,C<230;
(A⊕B)+(B⊕C)+(C⊕A)=X.

Help Chef come up with three such numbers or determine that no such tuple exists.
Here, ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer X - the number mentioned in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output three distinct numbers A, B and C (0≤A,B,C<230) such that (A⊕B)+(B⊕C)+(C⊕A)=X.
If multiple such tuples exist, print any. If no such tuple exists, print −1.
