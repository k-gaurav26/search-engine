Polo, the Penguin, likes the XOR operation. Please read NOTE if you are not familiar with XOR operation. 
XOR-sum of a list of numbers is the result of XOR-ing all of them. XOR-sum of (A[1] XOR A[2] XOR ... XOR A[N]) is defined as A[1] XOR (A[2] XOR (A[3] XOR ( ... XOR A[N]))).
He has an array A consisting of N integers. Index in the array are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive. Let us denote by F(L, R), the XOR-sum of all integers in the array A whose indices lie from L to R, inclusive, i.e. F(L, R) = A[L] XOR A[L+1] XOR ... XOR A[R]. Your task is to find the total sum of XOR-sums F(L, R) over all L and R such that 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of A. The second line contains N space-separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the total sum to the corresponding test case.
