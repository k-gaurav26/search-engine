Madoka was given a tree on her coming of age, and not a simple one, but a rooted tree of n vertices with a root at the vertex with the number 1.
For all i≥2, let Pi​ (1≤Pi​≤i−1) be the parent of the vertex i.
Let's define the depth array h as follows: h1​=1, and hi​=hPi​​+1 for all i≥2.
The subtree of a vertex u, denoted S(u), is defined as the set of vertices v such that the unique path from 1 to v contains u. Also, we define valu​=max{h(v):v∈S(u)}.
A tree is divided into paths by a ladder decomposition if each vertex is located on exactly one path, and each vertex u with at least one child lies in the same path as its child v with the maximum valv​, and if there are several such vertices, then the vertex with the minimum number is selected.
Madoka defines the beauty of a tree in the following way. Let the ladder decomposition of the path lengths be L1​,…,Lk​, then the beauty of the tree is L12​+L22​+⋯+Lk2​
For each i (1≤i≤n), your task is to calculate the beauty of the tree formed by the first i vertices.
Input

The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n - the size of the tree.
The second line contains n−1 integers P2​,…,Pn​.

Output
For each test case, print in a separate line a single integer - the answer to the problem.
