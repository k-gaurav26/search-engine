Problem
Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an integer sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and an integer X. Consider a N×N matrix B, where Bi,j​=Ai​+Aj​ for each valid i and j.
You need to find the number of square submatrices of B such that the sum of their elements is X. Formally, find the number of quartets (x1​,y1​,x2​,y2​) such that 1≤x1​≤x2​≤N, 1≤y1​≤y2​≤N, x2​−x1​=y2​−y1​ and ∑i=x1​x2​​∑j=y1​y2​​Bi,j​=X.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of square submatrices with sum X.
