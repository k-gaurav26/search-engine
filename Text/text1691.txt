Problem
You are given an array A of N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. Determine if there are two permutations B and C of this array, for which the following condition is satisfied:

There doesn't exist a pair of integers (i,j) such that 1≤i≤j≤N and (i,j)=(1,N), for which the subarray B[i:j] is a permutation of subarray C[i:j].

If there exist such permutations, find any of them.
As a reminder, B[i:j] refers to the subarray [Bi​,Bi+1​,…,Bj​]
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the number of integers.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, if there are no such permutations B and C, output NO.
Otherwise, on the first line output YES. In the next line, output N integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​. In the next line, output N integers C1​,C2​,…,CN​.
You may print each character of YES/NO in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yeS, YeS, and yEs will all be treated as identical).
