You are given a polynomial of degree N with integer coefficients. Your task is to find the value of this polynomial at some K different integers, modulo 786433.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the degree of the polynomial.
The following line of each test case contains (N+1) integers denoting the coefficients of the polynomial. The ith numbers in this line denotes the coefficient ai-1 in the polynomial a0 + a1 × x1 + a2 × x2 + ... + aN × xN. 
The following line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
The jth of the following Q lines contains an integer number xj denoting the query.
Output
For each query, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding query. In other words, the jth line of the output should have an integer equal to a0 + a1 × xj + a2 × xj2 + ... + aN × xjN modulo 786433.
