Problem
Read problems statements in Russian.
We define the GCD set of an array A of length N as the set containing the GCD of all prefixes of A. More formally, the GCD set G of A contains the values gcd([A1​]),gcd([A1​,A2​]),gcd([A1​,A2​,A3​]),…,gcd([A1​,A2​,…,An​]), where gcd(B) is the largest integer d such that all the numbers in array B are divisible by d. Note that all values in G are distinct.
For example, gcd([6])=6, gcd([6,12])=6, gcd([6,12,9])=3, and gcd([6,12,9,2])=1. Therefore, the GCD set of the array [6,12,9,2] is {1,3,6}.
You are given an integer set S of size M and two integers N,MOD, where MOD is a prime. You need to calculate the probability that the GCD set of P is equal to S, where P is a permutation of values 1 to N chosen uniformly randomly.
It can be shown that the answer is in the form of QP​ where P and Q are coprime non-negative integers and Q=0. You need to find the value P⋅Q−1(modMOD).
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N,M,MOD denoting the length of the permutation, the size of the given integer set, and the modulo respectively.
The second line of each test case contains m integers in increasing order S1​,S2​,…,SM​ representing the given integer set.

Output Format
For each test case, output on one line an integer equals to the answer of that test case.
