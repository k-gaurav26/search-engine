Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You work as an engineer. You were given an empty board with K consecutive cells; at any moment, each cell can display one character.
You want the board to display a string S with length N>K. Since the board isn't large enough, you want to display the string in N−K+1 steps. In the i-th step (1≤i≤N−K+1), you'll make the board display the characters Si​,Si+1​,…,Si+K−1​.
The power required to switch the board from step i to step i+1 (for 1≤i≤N−K) is equal to the number of characters displayed on the board that have to change between these steps. You should find the total power required for the whole process of displaying a string, i.e. the sum of powers required for switching between all consecutive pairs of steps.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains a single string S with length N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the total power required for text switching.
