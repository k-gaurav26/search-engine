Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
A rank list is a list of ranks of persons in a programming contest. Note that some of the persons might be having same rank. {1, 2}, {1, 2, 2} and {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4} are few examples of rank lists whereas {1, 3}, {0, 2}, {1, 2, 4} are not rank lists. 
Also note that a rank list need not to be sorted e.g. {2, 2, 1} and {3, 3, 2, 1} are valid rank lists.

Mathematically, a rank list is an array of numbers when sorted will have the starting element as 1 and difference between any two consecutive elements less than or equal to 1. 
A rank list is said to be an ideal rank list if no two persons gets equal rank in it. 
You can convert any rank list into an ideal rank list by applying following operations. In a single operation, you can change value of any one element of the rank list to any value. 
Chandan now wonders about minimum number of operations needed to convert a rank list of size n with sum of its element equal to s in to an ideal rank list. Please help Chandan find this minimum number of operations needed to create an ideal rank list.

Note that you are guaranteed that values of n, s will be given in such a way that there will exist a valid rank list.
Input
First line of input will give an integer T denoting number of test cases.
Then for next T lines, each line will contain two space separated integers n, s. 
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.
