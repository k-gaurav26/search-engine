Problem

Today, Ciel's restaurant is closed.
Ciel is bored, so she decides to take a walk randomly.


This town has N intersections and M one way roads.
The i-th road connects from the Ai-th intersection to the Bi-th intersection.
Ciel is in the 1st intersection now, and Ciel's house is in the N-th intersection.


If Ciel is in the i-th intersection, she will take a walk as follows:


If i = N, her walk is ended.
Otherwise, she chooses an integer k such that Ak = i uniformly randomly, she walks along the k-th road.


On the way, S intersections have beautiful flowers.
Let the F1-th intersection, the F2-th intersection, ..., and the FS-th intersection have beautiful flowers.
Can you tell the probability that Ciel last sees the flowers in the Fi-th intersection?
That is to say, can you tell the probability that she visits the Fi-th intersection, then she goes to N-th intersection without visiting other intersections having beautiful flowers?

Input

The first line contains 3 integers N, M and S.
Then, next line has S integers F1, F2, ..., FS.
Next M lines have 2 integers each, Ai and Bi.

Output

An output should contain S lines.
In the i-th line, print the probability that Ciel last sees beautiful flowers at the Fi-th intersection.
These values must have an absolute error no more than 10-6.
