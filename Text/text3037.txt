Problem
Read problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a positive integer k and an array a consisting of n integers. You will partition the array into k non-empty segments such that each number belongs to exactly one segment.
Let's denote si​ as the sum of all numbers belonging to i-th segment after partitioning. Your goal is to maximize the value of min(s1​,…,sk​). Calculate and print this value.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and k.
The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers a1​,…,an​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer --- the largest value of min(s1​,…,sk​) you can obtain.
