Problem
You are given a positive integer K and a tree with N vertices, rooted at vertex 1.
For all integer i (2≤i≤N), Pi​ is a parent of vertex i.
Let's call an array A consisting of N positive integers brilliant if the following constraints are met

APi​​modAi​=0, for all integer i (2≤i≤N).
∏i=1N​Ai​≤K.

Compute remainder modulo 998244353 of the number of possible brilliant arrays.
Input Format

The first line contains two integers N and K.
The second line contains N−1 integers P2​,P3​,...,PN​.

Output Format
Print the number of brilliant arrays. As it can be large, print it modulo 998244353.
