Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef likes arrays and anything related to it. He call an array V dominating if there exists a number x (the dominator) whose number of occurrences in V  strictly greater than half the size of the array (that is, floor(|V|/2)).

His friend Dmytro wants to make Chef happy, so he presented this interesting problem for Chef.
Given an array A. You have to process Q queries on it. Queries can be one of two types:

 1 x y  - Assign value y to x-th element in array A, i.e. Ax = y.
2 l r  - print "Yes" if subarray A[l..r] is dominating, "No" otherwise


Input
The first line of input contains two integers N and Q denoting the number of elements in A, and the number of queries to be executed.
The second line of input contains N space separated integers denoting the array A.
Each of the next Q lines contains one query.
Output
For each query of type 2, output the answer to the query in a single line.
