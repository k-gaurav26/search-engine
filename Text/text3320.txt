Problem
Phineas and Ferb have made the treehouse. They have now decided to spend time with Perry who is spending his off day (remember, Chef is dealing with Dr. Doofenshmirtz today). They have taught Perry about the binary number system. Now, to check whether Perry has understood properly, Phineas will ask some queries which Perry needs to answer correctly.
The tree contains N nodes and every node i (1≤i≤N) has a value Ai​ associated with it. All the edges are bidirectional. The tree is rooted at node 1. Phineas will ask Q queries in total. Each query can be of 2 types:


1 u v x - For every node r on the simple path between nodes u and v, apply bitwise OR operation on the associated value with the value x, i.e., replace Ar​ by Ar​∨x, where ∨ denotes the bitwise OR operation.


2 k y - Calculate the maximum value of Ar​⊕y over all nodes r in the subtree of node k, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The associated values of all the nodes will remain unchanged after this operation.


Help Perry answer the queries. Afterall, Perry is just a platypus. He doesn't do much.
Input

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of testcases.
The first line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers N and Q.
The next line contains N space separated integers denoting Ai​.
The next N−1 lines contain two space separated integers a and b, each denoting a bidirectional edge between the nodes a and b in the tree.
The next Q lines describe each query in the format given above.

Output
For each query of type 2, print the maximum possible XOR value in a new line.
