Mike likes to invent new functions. The latest one he has invented is called ForbiddenSum. Let's consider how it can be calculated:
You are given a set S of positive integers. The integers are not necessary distinct. ForbiddenSum of S equals to the minimal non-negative integer, that can't be returned by the algorithm described below: 


Choose a random subset S' of S(it can be empty as well);
	Calculate the sum of all the numbers of S' and assign it to the variable T;
	Return the value of the variable T.
	


I.e. if S = {1, 1, 3, 7}, the algorithm can return 0(S' = {}), 1(S' = {1}), 2(S' = {1, 1}), 3(S' = {3}), 4(S' = {1, 3}), 5(S' = {1, 1, 3}), but it can't return 6. So, ForbiddenSum of S equals to 6.


Inventing of new function is not the only Mike's hobby. Also, he likes to collect rare and unusual arrays. He is going to share with you one of them. 


Formally, Mike gives you one array A, consisting of N positive integers. After that, he asks you M questions, two integers Li and Ri describe i'th question: What does ForbiddenSum of S={ALi, ALi+1, ..., ARi-1, ARi} equal to?

Input
 
The first line contains the only integer N. The second line contains N integers - the array A. A is 1-indexed.
The third line contains the only integer M. The following M lines contain two integer numbers 1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ N each.
 
Output
Output should consists of M lines. The i'th line should contains the answer to the i'th question.
