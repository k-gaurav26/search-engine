Problem

According to many researches, people can stand on a bus for several hours, but waiting for a bus for more than 30 minutes at a bus station can make us exhausted. The Chef is a perfect example for this fact. He always tries to reduce the longest period of time of waiting for a bus. Therefore, optimizing the traveling plan for him is far from an easy task.


Let's consider the bus system with N bus stations (numbered from 1 to N) and M buses (numbered from 1 to M). Each bus is represented by 4 integer numbers U, V, S, E which means it will start at the bus station U at the time S and arrive at the bus station V at the time E with no intermediate bus stations. If passenger arrives at the bus station U at the time X ≤ S, he has to wait for S − X units of time to catch this bus. Note, that if he arrives at the bus station U exactly at time S he can catch this bus with no waiting time.


The Chef starts at the time 0 in the bus station 1, and he wants to arrive at the bus station N in a way that the longest period that he spends for waiting for a bus is as small as possible. Besides, he must be at the bus station N before or at the time T for a specially important meeting. Note, that he may wait for a meeting if he arrives at the bus station N early but that period is not our concern here, since he doesn't wait for any bus at that time.

Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, T and M, denoting the number of bus stations, the deadline for coming to bus station N and the number of buses, respectively. Each of the following M lines contains four space-separated integers U, V, S, E, the parameters of the current bus as described in the problem statement.

Output

If Chef cannot arrive at the bus station N before or at the time T, output -1. Otherwise, output the maximum period of time he has to wait for a bus in the optimal traveling plan.
