You are given a binary string S of N bits. The bits in the string are indexed starting from 1. S[i] denotes the ith bit of S.


Let's say that a sequence i1, i2, …, iK(1 ≤ K; 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < … < iK ≤ N) produces a palindrome when applied to S, if the string S[i1] S[i2] … S[ik] is a palindrome (that is, reads the same backward or forward).

 
In addition, a sequence i1, i2, …, iK(1 ≤ K; 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < … < iK ≤ N) is said to be exponential, if ij + 1 = p * ij for each integer 1 ≤ j < K and for some integer p > 1. Note, that a sequence of one element is always exponential.

Your task is to count the number of exponential sequences that produce a palindrome when applied to S.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of description for each test case contains a binary string S of N bits.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of exponential sequences that produce a palindrome.
