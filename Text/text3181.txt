Chef has a tree on N nodes. Each node v has an integer label Cv attached to it. Chef also has two other integers, A and B. He needs to run Q queries on the tree, each of which can be one of the following two types:
1 u v w — add w to the labels of all vertices which lie on a simple path between nodes u and v.
2 u v — find the number of vertices x on a simple path between u and v for which A*Cx + B ≥ 0.


Please help Chef run these queries.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains two positive numbers: N and Q.
The second line of each test case contains two positive numbers A and B.
The third line of each test case contains N integers — C1, C2, ... , CN — labels of the nodes.
The next N - 1 lines contain two integers u, v each, denoting a pair vertices connected by an edge. 
The following Q lines contains queries.
Output
For each query of the second type, output a single line containing a single integer — its result.
