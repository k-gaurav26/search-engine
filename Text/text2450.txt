You have a grid with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Initially, the grid is empty. You also have Nâ‹…M tiles with three colours: R tiles are red, G tiles are green and B tiles are blue.
Find a way to place these tiles in the grid such that for each tile, there are at most two distinct colours among the tiles that share a side with it.
For example, a valid placement for N=M=R=G=B=3 is:



### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers N, M, R, G and B.
### Output
For each test case, print N lines describing the placement of the tiles in the grid. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain a string with length M describing the tiles in the i-th row, with red, green and blue tiles denoted by the characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' respectively.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them. It can be proved that a solution always exists.
