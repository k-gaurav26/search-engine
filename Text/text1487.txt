Chef is playing a game against a magician. In this game, there are initially N identical boxes in front of Chef and one of them contains a magic pill ― after eating this pill, you would never get compilation errors ever again.
Chef has to determine which box contains the pill. He is allowed to perform at most M moves. In each move, Chef may do one of the following:

Choose one of the boxes that are in front of him uniformly randomly and guess that this box contains the pill. If the guess is correct, the game ends and Chef gets the pill. Otherwise, after this guess, the magician adds K empty boxes in front of Chef in such a way that Chef cannot determine which boxes were added; the box Chef guessed also remains in front of him and Chef cannot distinguish this box from the other boxes in subsequent moves either.
Choose a number X such that X is a positive multiple of K, but strictly less than the current number of boxes in front of Chef. The magician then removes X empty boxes. Of course, Chef must not perform this move if the current number of boxes is ≤K.

What is the probability that Chef gets the pill, assuming that he plays optimally ― in a way that maximises this probability? It can be proven that the maximum probability may be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are coprime positive integers. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 109+7, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and M.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― P⋅Q−1 modulo 109+7, where P/Q is the probability that Chef gets the pill.
