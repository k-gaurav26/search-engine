You are given a sequence of distinct non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
For every non-negative integer x<2K, let's define a function f(x) as the number of inversions in the sequence A1​⊕x,A2​⊕x,…,AN​⊕x. (An inversion in a sequence X1​,X2​,…,XN​ is a pair of indices (i,j) such that i<j and Xi​>Xj​.)
Consider the sorted sequence of pairs (f(x),x) for all integers x∈[0,2K−1]; a pair (f(x1​),x1​) is earlier than (f(x2​),x2​) in this sequence if f(x1​)<f(x2​), or if f(x1​)=f(x2​) and x1​<x2​. You should find the second element (i.e. the number x) of the P-th pair in this sequence. The sequence is indexed from 1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and P.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number x generating the P-th pair in the sorted sequence.
