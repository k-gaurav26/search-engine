Let's define a border substring of a string as a non-empty substring that's both a suffix and a prefix of this string.
You are given a string S with length N and Q queries. In each query, you are given the p-th prefix of S (let's denote it by S1..p) and an integer k. Consider the k-th shortest border of S1..p (if it exists). Compute the length of this border substring or determine that it doesn't exist.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains a single string S.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers p and k describing one query.

Output
For each test case, print Q lines. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ Q), the i-th of these lines should contain a single integer — the answer to the i-th query (the length of the k-th shortest border or -1 if it doesn't exist).
