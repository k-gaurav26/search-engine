Recently, Chef learned how to solve the Longest common subsequence problem. Being a fan of Ekta Kapoor1, he really likes problems which require finding something kth. Please help him solve one such problem he encountered.


Chef wants to know the lexicographically kth longest common subsequence of any two given strings A and B. In other words, let L be the length of LCS(A, B), S be the sorted set of all common sequences of A and B with length L, you should find Sk. Keep in mind that all elements of a set are distinct.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers n and k. The second line contains the string A, and the third contains the string B. Lengths of both A and B equal n. 
Output
Output lexicographically kth longest common subsequence. If such a sequence doesn't exist, output -1.
