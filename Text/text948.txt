The ugliness of a string is defined as the count of two consecutive ones i.e. "11" in the given string. For example, the ugliness of string "10111" is 2.
You are given an array A of N integers and you have to find any ordering of the array such that the ugliness of the concatenated string of the binary representations of the integers (without leading zeros) is minimum.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, output an ordering of A such that the ugliness of the array is minimum. If there are multiple answers, you may output any.
