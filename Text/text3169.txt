You are given an unrooted tree. There is an integer written on each node of this tree.
Your task is to count the number of ways to decompose this tree to a set of paths in such a way that each node belongs to exactly one path and the sum of numbers associated with all the nodes on any of these path is always non-negative.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ... , AN denoting the numbers written on the corresponding nodes. 
Each of the following (N-1) lines contain a pair of space-separated integers Xj Yj denoting that there is an edge between the nodes numbered Xj and Yj.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to decompose the tree to a set of paths, under the given condition, modulo 109+7.
