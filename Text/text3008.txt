Chef is busy preparing for the next lunchtime, so he has given you the following task.
You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers. The goodness of the array a is defined as the GCD of all the elements in the array.
Formally, goodness=GCD(a1​,a2​,…,an​).
You can perform the following type of operation:

Select any two elements of the array ai​ and aj​ (i=j and 1≤i,j≤n) and replace both ai​ and aj​ with ai​⋅aj​.

You can perform this operation at most once. Find the maximum goodness of the array.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,an​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer representing the maximum goodness of the array.
