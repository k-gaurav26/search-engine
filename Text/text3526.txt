Sereja is stuck with a problem and asks for your help. You readily agree to help Sereja and he poses the following problem to you. 
Sereja has a matrix  A of size N x N. Each cell in row i and column j contains a number A[i][j]. Every element of the matrix can either be 0 or 1. Initially, all the elements are zero. 
Sereja informs you that he only likes the functions of the form

Here the division is integer division, i.e. x/y means integer division of x by y.

Sereja can choose a set of integers a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d and two other integers l, r and applies the function f to the matrix as follows. He will substitute 1 in the every cell (i, j) where l ≤ i ≤ r and j = f(i).
Sereja gives you a matrix A after applying a certain number of functions to it. He asks you to find the minimal amount of functions such that after applying them Sereja will get the matrix A. You need not create the matrix A exactly, you are allowed to have at most 100 distinct cells in the matrix obtained after your operations and the matrix A. Your task is to minimize the number of such functions applied.
Input
 The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains an integer N. Each of the next N lines contains N digits (zero or one) without spaces denoting the matrix A.
Output
For each test case in first line output an integer corresponding to the number of functions Q.
Next Q lines should contain information about functions. Each lines should contain set of integers a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d, l, r. 
The following constraints must be satisfied for the output.

0 ≤ Q ≤ N*N
-N ≤ a1, b1, c1, d ≤ N
1 ≤ a2, b2, c2 ≤ N
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N
