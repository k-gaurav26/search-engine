Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You may know how to write a random number generator (RNG) after solving this problem (SEAPROAR).
Another way to write a RNG is to use linear recurrence relation. e.g. let's consider the following linear recurrence: 
Ai = (Ai−1 × C1 + Ai−2 × C2 + ... + Ai−k × Ck) mod 104857601, for i = k+1, k+2, ...,  where k is a positive integer. 

You are given initial values A1, A2, ..., Ak and the coefficients C1, C2, ..., Ck. Then the RNG can be used to generate any Ai for i larger than k.

Your task is to calculate AN for a given N.
Input
There is exactly one test case in each test file.
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers k and N as described in the statement. The second line contains k space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., Ak denoting the initial values as defined in the problem statement. Then the third line contains k space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., Ck, denoting the coefficients.
Output
Print a single integer denoting value of AN.
