Chef loves prime numbers and trees.
One day, Chef received N nodes (numbered 1 through N) as a gift. There are no edges between them yet, but each node contains a value; let's denote the value in node i by Vi​. Since Chef likes trees, he wants to form a tree by adding N−1 edges between these nodes.
Chef defines a subtree as any connected component obtained after deleting an edge. A tree with N nodes has 2(N−1) subtrees. A prime subtree is a subtree such that the sum of values in its nodes is a prime number.
Since Chef likes prime numbers too, he wants to maximize the number of prime subtrees in the resulting tree. Help him solve this difficult problem!
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers V1​,V2​,…,VN​.

Output
Print N−1 lines. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers u and v (1≤u,v≤N) denoting an edge between nodes u and v. The graph formed by these edges must be a tree.
