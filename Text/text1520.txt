Given N points in a 2D space, find the minimum sum of areas of rectangles required to cover all the points given that we can use at most 2 non-overlapping rectangles whose sides can touch. The rectangles must be axis-aligned, meaning the sides are vertical and horizontal.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains N+1 lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer N, the number of points.
The next N lines each contains two integers xi​, yi​, the coordinates of the i-th point.

Note: Points need not be distinct.
Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.
