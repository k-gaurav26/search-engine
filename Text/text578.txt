Problem
Read problems statements in Russian and Bengali.
You are given an integer N. Output a permutation of values from 1 to N that satisfies the following condition:

gcd([1+A1​,2+A2​,3+A3​,…,N+AN​])>1

It can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple permutations that can satisfy the condition, then output any one of them.
As a reminder,

A permutation of values from 1 to N is an array containing integers from 1 to N in any order but each of them appearing exactly once.
GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. The greatest common divisor of a sequence is the largest integer d such that all the numbers in sequence are divisible by d. For more information, refer to here.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output on one line a permutation of values from 1 to N which satisfies the above condition.
