Problem
You are given a positive integer N. You have to split each digit of N into either of two non-empty subsequences A or B.
For example, if N=104, some possible values of (A,B) can be (10,4),(14,0) and (1,4). Note that, after separating the digits into A and B, these subsequences are considered as positive integers and thus leading zeros can be omitted.
Let us define a function F(X,Y)=(X+Y)%2. Find out whether it is possible to find two non-empty subsequences A and B formed out of N such that F(A,B)=0.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, one integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if it is possible to find two non-empty subsequences A and B formed out of N such that F(A,B)=0. Otherwise, print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).
