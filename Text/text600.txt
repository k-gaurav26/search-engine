Problem
Given an integer N, help Chef in finding an N-digit odd positive integer X such that X is divisible by 3 but not by 9.
Note: There should not be any leading zeroes in X. In other words, 003 is not a valid 3-digit odd positive integer.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the T testcases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of digits in X.

Output Format
For each testcase, output a single line containing an N-digit odd positive integer X in decimal number system, such that X is divisible by 3 but not by 9.
