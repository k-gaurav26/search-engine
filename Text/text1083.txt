Problem
Mary loves binary strings.
Given a binary string S, she defines the beauty of the string as the bitwise XOR of decimal representations of all substrings of S.
Find the beauty of string S. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 998244353.
For example, the decimal representation of binary string 1101 is 1⋅23+1⋅22+0⋅21+1⋅20=8+4+0+1=13. Kindly refer sample explanation for more such examples.
A string A is a substring of a string B if A can be obtained from B by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the binary string.
Second line of each test case contains the binary string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, beauty of the string modulo 998244353.
