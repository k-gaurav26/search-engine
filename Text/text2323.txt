Problem
Doctor Kunj installed new software on cyborg Shresth.
This software introduced Shresth to range minimum queries.
Cyborg Shresth thought of T different problems in each of which you will be given
an array A of length N and an array B of length M. In each of these problems, you have to calculate:
∑i=1m​∑j=im​rangeMin(B[i],B[j])
Where rangeMin(i,j) returns the minimum element in the range of indices i to j (both included) in array A.
It is given that array B consists of pairwise distinct elements and is in ascending order.
Input Format:

First line will contain T, the number of different problems Cyborg Shresth thought of.
Each problem's input data will be given in three different lines.
The first line will contain N and M, the length of array A and B respectively.
The second line will contain N space separated positive integers, which form the array A. -
The third line will contain M space separated positive integers, which form the array B.

Output Format:

For each different problem, print on a new line the answer to the problem, i.e. the value of ∑i=1m​∑j=im​rangeMin(B[i],B[j]) .
