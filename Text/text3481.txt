Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
The statement of this problem is as easy as never before.
You are given an integer N, you need to find M positive integers A1, A2, A3, ..., AM, so that A1*A2*A3*...*AM would be equal to N. You should maximize the number M. 
Input

The first line of the input contains the integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.
Then T lines follow, each one is describing a single test case and contains a single positive integer N.

Output

For each test case, output the integer M on the first line of the testcases' output. Then, output M lines, where the i-th should contain the number Ai. Ai should be a positive integer, greater than 1.
Scoring

For each individual file, your score will be calculated as the sum of M2 over all the test cases in this file. Your score for the problem is the average of individual testcases' files scores. The number of points you'll get in the ranklist will be equal to YourScore/BestScore, where YourScore is naturally your score and BestScore is the best score, gained so far in this problem.


Please note that the score you get during the competition is the score on the 20% of the test data. The score on the complete test data will be available after the contest.
