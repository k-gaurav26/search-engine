A sophomore Computer Science student is frustrated with boring college lectures. Professor X agreed to give him some questions; if the student answers all questions correctly, then minimum attendance criteria will not apply to him.
Professor X chooses a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and asks Q queries. In each query, the student is given an integer P; he has to construct a sequence B1​,B2​,…,BN​, where P⊕Ai​=Bi​ for each valid i (⊕ denotes bitwise XOR), and then he has to find the number of elements of this sequence which have an even number of 1-s in the binary representation and the number of elements with an odd number of 1-s in the binary representation. Help him answer the queries.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains a single integer P describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the number of elements with an even number of 1-s and the number of elements with an odd number of 1-s in the binary representation.
