Sereja likes arithmetic progressions a lot. An infinite arithmetic progression (a, r) is determined by its initial term and difference of consecutive terms, denoted by a, r respectively.
He defines mutual attraction of some array A of size N with an infinite arithmetic progression (a, r), as |A1 - a| + |A2 - (a + r)| + .. + |Ai - (a + r * (i - 1)| + .. + |AN - (a + r * (N - 1)|, where |x| denotes absolute value of x.
He has an array A of size N with him. He wants to find some infinite arithmetic progression with which its mutual attraction is minimized. Also, he is allowed to perform following operations on this array. 

Swap operation: Take any two indices i, j of the array A, and swap Ai, Aj
Delete operation: Delete some element of the array A. Please note that after the deletion, the indices of array are not re-enumerated or re-adjusted.


So, you have to help Sereja in deciding how these operations should be performed on A and also in finding the parameters (a, r) of the infinite arithmetic progression. Note that Sereja can perform at max K swap operations and D delete operations.
Scoring
For each test file, there will be a single test case.
Your score for a single test file will be mutual attraction of the modified array A and the infinite arithmetic progression provided by you, divided by the initial size of array N. Your target is to minimize the score.
Input
There will be a single test case.
First line of input contains three space separated integers N, K, D.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting array A.
Output
You can print at max K + D + 2 lines.
In the first line, print two space separated real numbers denoting a, r, satisfying the constraints as mentioned in constraints section.
Then, you can print at max K + D lines, with each line having one of the following two formats.

Swap operation = 1 i j: i.e., 1 followed by the indices that you want to swap.
Delete operation = 2 i: i.e., 2 followed by index you want to delete.



Please end your output by printing -1 in a separate line.

Please note that you should ensure that indices that you are trying to swap or delete actually exist, otherwise you will get a WA verdict. The indices should be 1 based. Also note that after the deletion operation, the indices are not re-enumerated. Please see example input/output section for more details. Also note that if you make more than K swaps or more than D deletions, you will get a WA verdict.
