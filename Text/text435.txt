In a country called Chef Land, there was a lot of monetary fraud, so Chefu, the head of the country, decided to choose new denominations of the local currency ― all even-valued coins up to an integer N should exist. After a few days, a citizen complained that there was no way to create an odd value, so Chefu decided that he should also introduce coins with value 1. Formally, you are given an integer N; for v=1 and each even positive integer v≤N, coins with value v exist.
You are also given an integer S. To handle transactions quickly, find the minimum number of coins needed to pay a price S.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers S and N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of coins.
