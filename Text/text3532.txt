Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.
You are given a tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N).
A simple path between two different vertices a and b (a<b) is called a clamp path if it does not contain any vertices with numbers smaller then a or greater than b.
Calculate the number of clamp paths in the given tree.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers p1​,p2​,…,pN​. For each valid i, if pi​=0, then there is an edge between vertices i and pi​.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the number of clamp paths.
