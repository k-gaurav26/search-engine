Creatnx, a 7-year-old child, is playing with 7 sticks with lengths 1,2,…,7, which can be connected together. He is trying to use some of them to create a polygon. Trans, his father, is looking, and since he is a programmer, he quickly comes up with a problem based on this game:
There are N sticks (line segments) with lengths 1,2,3,…,N. You should choose a non-empty subset of these sticks and create a (simple, non-degenerate) polygon by connecting their endpoints together. How many such subsets of sticks can you choose? Since this number could be large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of subsets that can be chosen, modulo 109+7.
