 Chef has an array A consisting of N non-negative integers. Initially, all the elements are zero. Assume 1-based indexing. Chef is given two positive integers L and R. (L <= R) Chef has to execute Q number of queries on the array A. These queries can be of the following two types:

1 x y (1 ≤ x ≤ n) - Replace the value of xth array element by y.
 
2 l r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) - Return the number of subarrays [a , b] that lies in subarray [l , r] such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is atleast L and atmost R.
 
(A subarray [a , b] lies in a subarray [l , r] if and only if a >= l and b <= r)
 
Since, Chef couldn't solve this task, can you please help him solve this task?

Input
The first line contains four space separated positive integers N, Q, L and R denoting the total number of elements in an array, total number of queries, value of L, and value of R respectively.  
Each of the next Q lines contains one of the two queries described above.
Output
For each query of type 2, print the required answer in a new line.
