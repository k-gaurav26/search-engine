It's the soccer match finals in Chefland and as always it has reached the penalty shotouts.
Each team is given 5 shots to make and the team scoring a goal on the maximum number of shots wins the game. If both the teams' scores are equal, then the game is considered a draw and we would have 2 champions.
Given ten integers A1​,A2​,…,A10​, where the odd indexed integers(A1​,A3​, A5​, A7​,A9​) represent the outcome of the shots made by team 1 and even indexed integers(A2​,A4​,A6​,A8​,A10​) represent the outcome of the shots made by team 2 (here Ai​=1 indicates that it's a goal and Ai​=0 indicates a miss), determine the winner or find if the game ends in a draw.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains ten space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,A10​.
