Problem
Given a positive integer N, construct two arrays A and B, each of size N such that:

Ai​=Aj​ for all (1≤i<j≤N);
Bi​=Bj​ for all (1≤i<j≤N);
Ai​=Bj​ for all (1≤i,j≤N);
1≤Ai​,Bi​≤3⋅105 for all (1≤i≤N);
⊕A[1,i]=⊕B[1,i] for all (1≤i≤N) such that i is even.

Here ⊕A[L,R] corresponds to the bitwise XOR of all elements of the subarray [L,R] of array A. Similarly, ⊕B[L,R] corresponds to the bitwise XOR of all elements of the subarray [L,R] of array B.
If multiple answers are possible, ouput any.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, a single integer N - as mentioned in statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output two lines.

The first line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array B.

If multiple answers are possible, ouput any.
