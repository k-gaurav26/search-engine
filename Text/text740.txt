Problem

Codechef challenges have three divisions. In one challenge, there are N problems in each division, but some problems may be shared among multiple divisions. Each problem is uniquely identified by a code — a string containing only uppercase English letters. Each participant can only submit in one of the divisions.
Chef wants to find the number of correct solutions, in total among all 3 divisions, for each problem. Given a list of N problem codes with the numbers of correct solutions for each problem in each division, find the total number of correct solutions for each problem and sort them in non-decreasing order.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string S3,i​ followed by a space and an integer C3,i​ — the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the i-th problem in the third division.
N more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string S2,i​ followed by a space and an integer C2,i​ — the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the i-th problem in the second division.
Finally, N more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string S1,i​ followed by a space and an integer C1,i​ — the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the i-th problem in the first division.

Output
For each test case, let P be the number of distinct problems; you should print P space-separated integers — the number of solutions for each of these problems, sorted in non-decreasing order.
