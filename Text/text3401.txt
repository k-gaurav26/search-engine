A positive integer N≥1 is given.
An N-uple (x1​,x2​,…,xN​) of nonnegative integers is special if, after we remove all entries which are zero, its entries are nondecreasing. For example (0,2,0,0,4,0,4,5,0,0) is special, but (3,2,0) and (0,1,3,0,0,1,0) are not.
One can show that there is a unique function μ defined on the N-uples of nonnegative integers such that, for any N-uple x=(x1​,x2​,…,xN​)
\begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if x is special} \\
    0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases},$$
where the sum ranges over all $N$-uples $y=(y_1, y_2,\dots, y_N)$ of nonnegative integers such that $y_i\le x_i$ for all $1\le i\le N$.

You are given $x=(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_N)$, determine whether $\mu(x)$ is $0$ or not.


### Input Format
- The first line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains one integer $N$, the size of the tuple considered.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N$, the entries of the given $N$-uple.
### Output Format
For each test case, print the string <tt>yes</tt> if $\mu(x)=0$ and the string <tt>no</tt> otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).
