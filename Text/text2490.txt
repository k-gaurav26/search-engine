Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
This problem's statement is really a short one.
You are given an integer S. Consider an infinite sequence S, 2S, 3S, ... . Find the first number in this sequence that can be represented as Q3, where Q is some positive integer number. As the sought number could be very large, please print modulo (109 + 7).
The number S will be given to you as a product of N positive integer numbers A1, A2, ..., AN, namely S = A1 * A2 * ... * AN
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
Then there is a line, containing N space separated integers, denoting the numbers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the first term of the sequence which is the perfect cube, modulo 109+7.
