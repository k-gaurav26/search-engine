Problem

Recently, chef Ciel often hears about lucky numbers.



Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers
whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7.
For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.



Ciel decides to make Ciel numbers.
As you know, Ciel likes the digit 8 very much.
And then, Ciel likes the digits 5 and 3.
So Ciel defines Ciel numbers as the positive integers k such that d(k, 8) ≥ d(k, 5) ≥ d(k, 3) and d(k, i) = 0 for all i = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9,
where d(k, i) denotes the number of the digit i in the decimal representation of the integer k.
For example, the first few Ciel numbers are 8, 58, 85, 88, 358, 385, 538, 583, 588, 835, 853, 858, 885, 888, ....


Ciel's restaurant has N menus.

Your task is to find it.

Input
