Problem
You are given two arrays A and B, each of size N. You can perform the following types of operations on array A.

Type 1: Select any prefix of A and increment all its elements by 1.
Type 2: Select any suffix of A and increment all its elements by 1.

Your task is to transform the array A into array B using the minimum number of operations. If it is impossible to do so, output −1.
For an array A having N elements:

A prefix of the array A is a subarray starting at index 1.
A suffix of the array A is a subarray ending at index N.

Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of arrays A and B.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, where the ith integer denotes Ai​.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, where the ith integer denotes Bi​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ―  minimum operations required to convert A into B. Print −1 if it is impossible to convert A into B.
