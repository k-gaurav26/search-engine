Chef gets N orders. The orders are numbered from 1 to N. He gets order i at Si time, and this order contains Xi number of items. Chef needs to serve each of these Xi items before Di time and for each unit of items he cannot cook before this deadline he needs to pay Pi unit of money as penalty. Given all of the orders, help the Chef to minimize the penalty he will have to pay.  Important Note: Chef can cook at most one item at a unit time and for each item he needs exactly one unit of time to cook. Also Chef can serve an item instantly, when the item is cooked. If Chef wants to serve an item at time t, then the latest he can cook that item is at time time t. In another words, for order i Chef can cook the items at time units Si, Si+1, Si+2, ..., Di-1. Please note, that Chef can not cook items from order i exactly at time unit Di.
