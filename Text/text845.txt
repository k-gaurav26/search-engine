Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef found a very useful open-source code for the current problem. Unfortunately, one fragment of code isn't optimized. Consider that problem: given an array D of size N and Q queries X to the following open-source code:


read X
for i = 1..N:
    X = floor(X / D[i])
print X


Help Chef to optimize that code for all possible X, he will be very thankful :)
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  The first line of each test case contains two integers - N and Q. The second line contains array D. The third line contains Q queries - X1, X2, ..., XQ. 

 
Output

For every test case in single line output Q integers - for each Xi output result for this query.
