Pishty is a little boy who lives in Khust, an ancient town with a castle and smart bears. Right now, he wants you to help him with a programming problem.


You are given a sequence A1, A2, ..., AN and Q queries. There are two types of queries:

1 pos val — Set Apos = val.
2 l r — Find the maximum possible perimeter of a triangle with non-zero area whose sides are elements of the subsequence Al, Al+1, ..., Ar. Note that each element of the subsequence can only be used as the length of at most one side, i.e. the sides of each valid triangle must be elements Ax, Ay, Az, where l ≤ x < y < z ≤ r.



For each query of the second type, compute the maximum possible perimeter or determine that no valid triangle exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines describes one query in the following format:

1 pos val for a query of the first type
2 l r for a query of the second type


Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum perimeter or 0 if no triangle can be formed.
