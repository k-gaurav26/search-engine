You are given N distinct points on a two-dimensional plane. It is guaranteed that no three of them are collinear. Let's call a subset of these points compact if the convex hull of this subset has exactly four vertices.
Find the number of compact non-empty subsets of the given points. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting the coordinates of one point.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of compact subsets modulo 109+7.
