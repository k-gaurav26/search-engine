Kirito faced a dangerous labyrinth, and now he requires your help.
He's in a tunnel which contains N different rooms. Each room contains Ai monsters inside it. He starts from room 1. Every time he stays near a room X, he may go in and clear it from monsters, or just leave the room locked and move to the room X+1. However, if he clears a room with K monsters, and the next room he clears consists of L monsters, then the greatest common divisor of K and L must be greater than 1, otherwise he will die (awful curse). Formally, let us say that the order of rooms he visited is i1,  i2, , ..., it. Then gcd(Aij, Aij + 1) > 1 for all j < t. Help him cross all the rooms by clearing the maximum number of rooms.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number elements in sequence.
The second line of each test case contains N integers where i-th integer is number of monsters in room Ai.
Output
For each test case, output the maximum number of rooms he could clear. (Kirito should survive.)
