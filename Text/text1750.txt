Chef has recently learnt about sequences of parentheses. These are special sequences that contain only the characters '(' and ')'.
A regular parentheses sequence follows the following definition:  

An empty sequence is regular
If S is a regular sequence, then (S) is also regular
If A and B represent two regular sequences, then their concatenation AB is also regular.
Therefore, the sequences (), ()() and (())() are regular, while ()(, ) and ))() are non-regular.
Now, you need to find the longest subsequence of the given sequence which is non-regular. Amongst all such distinct answers, output the lexicographically Kth amongst them. If the number of distinct subsequences with maximum length is less than K, please output -1 instead.
Input:
The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to follow.
Each of the test cases have exactly two lines, the first contains the parentheses sequence and the second contains the value of K.
Output:
Output exactly T lines, each containing answer to the corresponding query.
