A string is almost palindromic if we can rearrange its characters in such a way that it becomes a palindrome. A positive integer is almost palindromic if its decimal representation without leading zeros is an almost palindromic string.
You are given two integers L and R. Find the number of almost palindromic integers between L and R (inclusive). Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R (without leading zeros).

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of almost palindromic integers modulo 109+7.
