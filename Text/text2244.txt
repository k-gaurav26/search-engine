Problem
Utkarsh is forced to play yet another game with Ashish.
In this game there are N piles, ith pile contains Ai​ stones. Utkarsh moves first.
In Utkarsh's turn, Ashish chooses a pile (which contains at least 1 stone), then Utkarsh removes any non-zero number of stones from that pile. Similarly, in Ashish's turn, Utkarsh chooses a pile with at least 1 stone, then Ashish removes any non-zero number of stones from that pile. The player who makes the last move wins.
Determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the number of piles.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​, where Ai​ denotes the number of stones in the ith pile.

Output Format
For each test case, output on one line Utkarsh if Utkarsh wins the game, else output Ashish.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings Utkarsh, utkarsh, UTKARSH and uTkArSh will all be treated as identical).
