Problem
Given an array A consisting of N non-negative integers.
You need to perform the following operation (N−1) times:

Sort the array A in ascending order.
Let M be the current size of the array A. Replace the array A by [(A2​−A1​),(A3​−A2​),…,(AM​−AM−1​)]. Note that each time the operation is performed, the size of the array reduces by one.

Find the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, output single line: the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
