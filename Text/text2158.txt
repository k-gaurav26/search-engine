We all know that Chef got a box of N chocolates (numbered 1 through N) as his birthday present. For each valid i, the i-th chocolate has a sweetness value Wi​. Chef is going to play the following randomised game for fun with his brother:

First, an integer k between 1 and N (inclusive) is chosen uniformly randomly.
Then, k times, Chef chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently (each chocolate may be chosen multiple times). For each i (1≤i≤k), let's denote the sweetness of the i-th chocolate chosen by Chef by Ai​.
Chef's brother does the same thing ― k times, he also chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently from each other or Chef's choices (so each chocolate may still be chosen multiple times). For each i (1≤i≤k), let's denote the sweetness of the i-th chocolate chosen by Chef's brother by Bi​.
The score of the game is ∑i=1k​∑j=1k​gcd(Ai​,Bj​).

Find the expected value of the score. It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction QP​, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers W1​,W2​,…,WN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353.
