Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Chef Smurf likes strings a lot but he likes balanced strings more. Smurf calls a string S a balanced string if and only if characters of strings S can be partitioned into two multi-sets M1 and M2 such that M1 = M2.For eg : Strings such as aabbcc, abcabc , baccba , abccba are all balanced strings as their characters can be partitioned into two multi-sets M1 and M2 such that M1 = M2 = {a,b,c}  whereas strings such as aba, abc , abcdef, blablah are not balanced strings.
Today, Smurf found a special string P consisting of N lower case Latin letters. Smurf wants to make some queries about his string P.
Each of Smurf's query consists of 3 integers L R type. For a given query, Smurf wants to calculate this :    
                                        
For all Ts,e, where Ts,e is balanced string such that starting index s and ending index e of a chosen string Ts,e satisfies L ≤ s < e ≤ R.
Note : |Ts,e| denotes the length of string Ts,e.
Just to make this problem little bit more interesting, given input is encoded. Instead of L and R in each query, you will be provided with two integers X and Y. Two keys A and B are used to decode the given input.

void decode(){
    A = 0 ; // initialising first key 
    B = 0 ; // initialising second key 
    Q = input(); // number_of_queries;
    while( Q -- ) {
        X = input(); 
        Y = input();
        type = input() ;
        L = ( X + A ) % N + 1; // decoding L
        R = ( Y + B ) % N + 1; // decoding R
        // N is the length of the given string
        if (L > R) {
            // swap L and R
            int T = L;
            L = R;
            R = T;
        }  
        ans = solve(L,R,type); // calculate answer for current query
        A = B;     // updating key A 
        B = ans;   // updating key B 
    } 
}


Smurf cannot accomplish this task alone. Can you help him ?
Input
First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a string P denoting the chef's special string. Next line of the each test case contains a single integer Q denoting the number of chef's queries. Next Q lines of the each test case contains three space separated integers denoting X, Y and type respectively.
Output
For each of the chef's query, print the required answer.
Note 
Two substrings Ts1,e1 and Ts2,e2 are considered to be different if either s1 != s2 or e1 != e2 where s1,e1 and s2,e2 are the starting and ending indices of string T1 and string T2 respectively.
