Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You are given a tree of N nodes numbered from 1 to N. 
The ith edge connecting node ui and vi has a weight of wi.


Your target is to handle the queries of the following two types:


"1 i c" : Update the weight of ith edge with the new weight c.  
  (1 represents the query type). 

"2 u v" : Find the length of the path from node u to v. (2 represents the query type).


Input

The first line contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N - 1 lines contains three integers u v w, representing an edge 
  between u and v with the weight of w.
The next line contains a single integer Q representing the number of queries
Each of the next Q lines contains three integers representing a query as described above.

Output

For each query of type 2, output the answer in a single line.
