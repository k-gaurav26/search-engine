You are given two positive integers N,K, where Kâ‰¤N. Your goal is to find the number of permutations of {1,2,...,N} with exactly K inversions. As the answer may be very large, you only need to find it modulo 2.
Input:

The first line contains one integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers N,K.

Output:
For each test case, print one integer: the number of permutation of N elements with K inversions, modulo 2.
