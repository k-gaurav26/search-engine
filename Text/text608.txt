Problem
Chef was recently studying the Bitwise OR operation, and stumbled upon the following problem:
Let F(i)=1 ∣ 2 ∣ 3 ∣ … ∣ i, where ∣ denotes bitwise OR.
You are given an integer N. Find the number of distinct i such that 2≤i≤N and F(i)=F(i−1).
Input Format

The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct i such that 2≤i≤N and F(i)=F(i−1).
