Problem
An input string S of length N is transferred through the network using a special protocol. The protocol can send the string through a series of operations. In one operation, we can choose a lowercase english alphabet C and do one of the following:

Transfer 1 copy of C through the network.
Transfer 2 copies of C through the network.

Each of the above transfers take 1 unit of time.
Find the minimum time in which we can transfer the entire string S through the network.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains N - the length of the string S.
Second line of each test case contains the string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to transfer the string.
