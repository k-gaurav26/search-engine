Problem
You are given two sets of points S and T on the xy-plane. S contains N points and T contains  M points.
The points (xi​,yi​) in T have a special property - for every 1≤i<M, xi+1​>xi​ and yi+1​<yi​.
For each point (x,y)∈T, find the minimum Manhattan distance between (x,y) and a point in S. Formally, for each (x,y)∈T, find
min(xi​,yi​)∈S​(∣x−xi​∣+∣y−yi​∣)
Input Format

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers N and M - the size of S and T, respectively.
The next N lines each contain two space-separated integers xi​ and yi​, representing the points of S.
The last M lines each contain two space-separated integers xi​ and yi​, representing the points of T.

Output Format

For each test case, output M lines. The i-th of these lines should contain a single integer, the minimum Manhattan distance between the i-th point in T and a point in set S.
