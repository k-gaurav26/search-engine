You are given a string S with length N and you should change it to a palindrome using a sequence of zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two adjacent elements of S (two characters) and swap them; however, neither of these elements may be used in any other operation.
Find the minimum number of operations you have to perform in order to change the string S into a palindrome, or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains a single string S with length N.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to make the string S a palindrome, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain a single integer â€• the minimum required number of operations.
