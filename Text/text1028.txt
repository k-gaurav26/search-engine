Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Chef Anup is making dishes. Each dish consists of N ingredients, and quantity of each ingredient is an integer between 1 and K inclusive.
Relative quality of 2 dishes is determined by their lexicographic order. Dish A is of lower quality than dish B if there is a position i (1<=i<=N) such that Aj = Bj for all j < i and Ai < Bi. E.g., if N = 2 and K = 2, then the possible dishes in lexicographic order are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). 
Given an integer L, determine the Lth possible dish in increasing order of quality.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case description consists of a single line containing three integers N, K and L as described above.

### Output Format
For each test case, print N space-separated integers in a single line describing the quantities of the ingredients for the Lth dish.
