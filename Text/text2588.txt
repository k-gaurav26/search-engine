Problem
Winter is here and so are the white walkers.
The war against white walker is going on a 2-D plane.
Jon Snow, the heir to the Iron Throne is standing at (0,0) on the plane.
N white walkers are coming towards the wall to attack the night's watch.
Currently each white walker is at a fixed point (xi​,yi​)  on the 2-D plane.
Horizontal distance between two points (x1​,y1​) and (x2​,y2​) is ∣x1​−x2​∣, and vertical distance between them is ∣y1​−y2​∣.
There are Q queries to answer.
Each query is of the form LRK.    (1≤L≤R≤N)
For each query, only white walkers in the range [L,R] have to be considered.
Active white walkers in this range [L,R] are only those whose horizontal distance from Jon is not more than K units.
The POWER of the active white walker army is calculated as the XOR sum of the number of divisors of the vertical distance of active enemies from Jon.
Jon knows that the active army is of no harm if their power is 0.
Jon snow has a weapon with which he can kill exactly one active white walker, such that killing him will render the army powerless.
Can you help Jon to find out for each query how many choices does he have to kill exactly one white walker such that the army becomes powerless?
Input:

First line contains N. The number of white walkers in the army.
Next N lines contains 2 integers - (xi​,yi​) each denoting the x and y coordinate of white walkers.
Next line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Next Q lines contains 3 integers each. L, R and K.

Output :

For each query print the number of white walkers Jon can target to make the army powerless.
