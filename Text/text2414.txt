Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Let's consider a square matrix of size N × N, where N = R −­­­­­­­­­­­ L + 1. We will enumerate the columns of this matrix with consecutive integers from L to R (the leftmost column will be assigned number L and the rightmost - number R). In similar manner we will enumerate rows with the same integers (the top row will be assigned number L and the bottom row - number R).
Every cell of this matrix has an integer written inside it. The cell at the intersection of row X and column Y has integer (X xor Y) written inside.
Two cells are called adjacent if and only if they have a common side. That way every inner cell have 4 neighbors and any of four corner cells have 2 neighbors.
A walk is a sequence of cells C0, C1, C2, ..., CK, where for every 1 ≤ i ≤ K the cells Ci-1 and Ci are adjacent and for every 0 ≤ j ≤ K the number written inside cell Cj is equal j. The number K is the length of that walk.
Your task is for given L and R values, find the maximal possible value of K, as well as the count C of different walks with that maximal length. As the value of C could be very large, output it modulo (109 + 7).
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows. 
For each test case, the only line of input contains two integers L and R.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing two integers K and C. The value of C should be printed modulo (109 + 7).
