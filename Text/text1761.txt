Problem
Read problem statements in Russian, Mandarin and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a permutation P of integers from 1 to N, and an integer K such that ⌈32N​⌉≤K≤N. In one operation, you can do the following:

Choose any consecutive segment of at most K elements of the permutation, and sort it in increasing order.

What's the smallest number of operations you have to make to sort the entire permutation in increasing order?
Input Format


The first line of the input contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.


The first line of each test case contains two integers N,K.


The second line of each test case contains N integers P1​,P2​,…,PN​ − the elements of the permutation.


Output Format
For each test case, output the smallest number of operations you have to make to sort the entire permutation in increasing order.
