Probably everyone has experienced an awkward situation due to shared armrests between seats in cinemas. A highly accomplished cinema manager named "Chef" decided to solve this problem.


When a customer wants to buy a ticket, the clerk at the ticket window asks the visitor if they need the armrests, and if so, which of them: left, right, or both. We know that out of the audience expected to show up, L of them only need the left armrest, R of them need just the right one, Z need none and B need both. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of people that can attend the show. In the cinema hall there are N rows with M seats each. There is only one armrest between two adjacent seats. Seats at the beginning and at the end of the row have two armrests
