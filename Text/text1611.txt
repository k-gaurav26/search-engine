Problem
Read problem statements in Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, and Vietnamese as well.
There are three distinct points - A,B,C in the X−Y plane. Initially, you are located at point A. You want to reach the point C satisfying the following conditions:

You have to go through point B.
You can move in any of the four axis-parallel directions (+X, −X, +Y, −Y direction). However, you can make at most one turn in the path from A to C.

Determine if it is possible to reach the destination C satisfying the above conditions.
NOTE:

One turn means 90∘  clockwise or anticlockwise rotation along the direction of movement. For example, if you are moving towards the +X direction, after one turn you can move either in the +Y direction or in the −Y direction. Changing the direction by 180∘ is not allowed.

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers XA​,YA​, denoting the coordinates of the starting point A.
The second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers XB​,YB​, denoting the coordinates of the point B.
The third line of each test case contains two space-separated integers XC​,YC​, denoting the coordinates of the finishing point C.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one string - "YES"(without quotes) if it is possible to reach the finishing point satisfying the above conditions, otherwise print "NO"(without quotes).
