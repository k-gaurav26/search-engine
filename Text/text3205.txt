Problem
Read problem statements in Mandarin, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given two arrays A and B of length N. The array B contains only zeros and ones.
You are given Q queries, each of which consists of two integers L and R, L≤R.
Consider a partition of the interval [L,R] into some k≥1 subintervals [l1​,r1​],[l2​,r2​],…,[lk​,rk​] satisfying the following conditions:

l1​=L and rk​=R
li​≤ri​ for every 1≤i≤k
ri​+1=li+1​ for every 1≤i<k
Bli​​+Bli​+1​+⋯+Bri​​=1 for every 1≤i≤k

Note that you are free to choose any k≥1.
Define the sum of a subinterval [li​,ri​] to be sum(li​,ri​)=Ali​​+Ali​+1​+⋯+Ari​​.
Given a partition of [L,R] into subintervals, define its goodness to be the number of subintervals in the partition with non-negative sum.
Find and print the maximum goodness over all partitions satisfying the given conditions.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.
Q lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers L,R.

Output Format
For each query, output in a single line the maximum goodness of a partition of [L,R]. If there is no possible partition, print 0.
