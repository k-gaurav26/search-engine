Eugene loves sequences, especially arithmetic progressions. One day he was asked to solve a difficult problem.

If a sequence of numbers A1, A2, ... , AN form an arithmetic progression A, he was asked to calculate sum of F(Ai), for L ≤ i ≤ R.
F(X) is defined as:
If X < 10 then F(X) = X.
Else F(X) = F(sum_of_digits(X)).

Example:
F(1378) = 
F(1+3+7+8) = 
F(19) = 
F(1 + 9) = 
F(10) = 
F(1+0) = 
F(1) = 1
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case is described in one line containing four integers: A1 denoting the first element of the arithmetic progression A, D denoting the common difference between successive members of A, and L and R as described in the problem statement.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing one integer denoting sum of F(Ai).
