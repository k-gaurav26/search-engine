Problem
Sasuke and Itachi are playing a game. Sasuke first creates an array A containing N positive integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. He then creates a new array B of length N such that Bi​=gcd(A1​,A2​,...,Ai​) for each 1≤i≤N. Now, Sasuke gives array B to Itachi and asks him to find any array A (with 1≤Ai​≤109) such that the given process applied to A will produce B. Can you help Itachi solve this problem?
Here, gcd stands for greatest common divisor.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers denoting the array A you constructed. If no such array A exists, print −1 instead.
