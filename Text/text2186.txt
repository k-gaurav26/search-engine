Masha has N minions. Each minion has two characteristics: power a and endurance b. Masha thinks that a non-empty set of minions {m1​,m2​,…,mk​} with characteristics (am1​​,bm1​​),(am2​​,bm2​​),…,(amk​​,bmk​​) is good if the mean endurance of this set doesn't exceed the minimum power in it, i.e. if min(am1​​,am2​​,…,amk​​)≥(bm1​​+bm2​​+⋯+bmk​​)/k.
Masha would like to choose a good subset of her minions and give these minions to Mark. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of minions Masha can give to Mark.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The following N lines describe minions. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers a and b denoting the power and endurance of one minion.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one number — the size of the largest good set of minions, or 0 if no such set exists.
