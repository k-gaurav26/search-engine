Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Little Petya likes integer numbers a lot. Recently he has received a sequence of integers as a gift from his mother. Petya calls a sequence of N integers Ai beautiful if there exist a sequence of N integer numbers Bi for which the following conditions hold:

 At least one number Bi differs from 0. 
 For every j from 0 to N-1 the following holds:  A0* Bj + A1* B(j + 1) mod N + ... + AN-1* B(j + N - 1) mod N = 0.

Please, help Petya to check if his sequence Ai is beautiful.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in Petya's sequence. The second line contains N space-separated integers A0, A1, ..., AN-1 denoting the sequence.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the word "YES"(without quotes) if Petya's sequence is beautiful and "NO", otherwise.
