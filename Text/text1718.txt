Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

You are given a one dimensional integer array A of length N. You need to maintain the array under Q queries of the following four types. Assume 1-based indexing and M = 109 + 7.


Query 1 : 1 x y v 
This implies adding v to array A to all the indices from x to y, i.e.,


for (i = x; i <= y; i++)	
	Ai += v;
	Ai %= M; 



Query 2 : 2 x y v  
This implies multiplying the scalar v with the array A for all the indices from x to y, i.e.,


for (i = x; i <= y; i++)	
        Ai *= v
        Ai %= M



Query 3 : 3 x y v 
This implies initializing the array A at all the indices from x to y with the value v, i.e.,


for (i = x; i <= y; i++)	
	Ai = v 



Query 4 : 4 x y
This is a report query which needs to find the sum of the values in A from x to y, i.e.,


sum = 0;
for (i = x; i <= y; i++)
	sum += Ai
	sum %= M
Output sum.


Note: a%b represents the remainder of a when divided by b.
Input
First line contains two space separated integers N, Q.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the array A.
Next Q lines contain queries which can be of any of the above four types.
Output
For each query of type 4, output a single integer corresponding to the answer in a single line.
