Chef Ada loves trees, she thinks that the beauty of a tree is determined by the distance between its center and centroid. If the tree has multiple centers or centroids, then the beauty is the maximum among every possible pair.


As a reward for her delicious dishes (and awesome coding skills), CodeChef is going to give a present to Chef Ada, and of course it must be a tree! But not any tree, we want to give her one with n nodes, and beauty b. Help find such a tree.

Input

The first line of input contains one number T, the number of test cases.


Each test case contains two integers n and b, the desired number of vertices and beauty.

Output

For each test case, if no tree satisfies the conditions print "NO" in a new line.


Otherwise, print "YES" in a new line and describe any valid tree. Print n-1 more lines, each with two integers ui, vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n) denoting the indices of the vertices connected by an edge in the tree.
