Problem
You are given a tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. It is rooted at node 1, and each node i is labelled with a positive integer labeli.
‘Y Figures’ of a node X are defined as the number of ordered triplets of nodes (A, B, C) satisfying:

labelA = labelB = labelC = labelX.
A is an ancestor of X.
B and C are in the subtree of X and LCA(B,C) = X. 
A, B, C, X are pairwise distinct.

You need to answer Q queries of the form ‘X Z’. For each query, Change the label of node X to Z and report the number of ‘Y Figures’ of the node X.  
Note: Changes are not persistent. Each query is independent of every other query. 
It is advised to use fast I/O methods.
Input

First Line of Input consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases.
First line of every test case contains of two Integers, N and Q,  denoting number of nodes in the tree and the number of queries respectively.
The second line of input consists of N integers,  where the i-th integer represents labeli, the label of node i (1-indexed).
The next N - 1 lines contain two integers, a and b,  denoting that an edge exists between node a and node b.
The next Q lines contain two integers, X and Z where X is the node and Z is the new label of the node for the current query.

Output

For every testcase, output Q lines, where each line is the answer to each query in the order of input.
