You are given a directed acyclic graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges. You want to destroy it all! To destroy the graph, you should delete all of its vertices.
In one step, you are allowed to delete at most two vertices; you may only delete a vertex when there is no edge from it to another (not yet deleted) vertex. You may not delete two vertices when there is an edge between them either.
Find a way to destroy the graph in the minimum number of steps.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers U and V denoting an edge from vertex U to vertex V.

Output

The first line of the output should contain a single integer S denoting the minimum number of steps needed to destroy the graph.
Each of the next S lines should describe one step; it should contain an integer K (1≤K≤2), followed by a space and K space-separated integers denoting the numbers of vertices deleted in this step.
