Problem
There was a kingdom 'Exodistaan' ruled by 'JonSnow'. The kingdom was divided into n x m cities. The cities are arranged in a grid, with n rows of m cities each. Now the ruler 'JonSnow' had a list of enemies (not exceeding 10). The enemies want Exodistaan for themselves, as it is quite popular. Their strategy was to first attack the cities row-wise and then attack column-wise. The enemies attacked the rows and were able to capture some continuous segments of cities in some rows. Each row was attacked by at most one enemy. Now they want to attack columns and all the columns which have maximum number of distinct rulers will be attacked first. 'JonSnow' is busy in preparing for the  war. You have to help him which columns will be attacked and what is the maximum number of distinct rulers (including 'JonSnow').
Input:

The first line contains three integers n,m,k.
Each of the next k lines contains 4 values i,l,r,S.
This means that in row i, cities from column l to column r both inclusive have been captured by enemy S.

Output:
Print 2 space separated integers A and B, where:

A is the number of columns which will be attacked.
B is the maximum number of distinct rulers in the columns.
