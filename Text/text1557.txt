Problem
Consider an array A={a1​,a2​,...,an​} of size n≥1. If ak​=2x−1 for all 1≤k≤n,  for some integer x (1≤x≤60), then A is called interesting array.
You are given a number C. Find any interesting array A of minimum possible size such that a1​⨁a2​⨁...⨁an​=C, where ⨁ represents bitwise XOR operation.
If there exists multiple such arrays, output any one.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains single integer C on a single line.

Output Format

For each testcase, on the first line output the minimum possible size of array A satisfying the given property.
On the next line output the elements of array A in any order.
