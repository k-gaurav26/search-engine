Problem
You are given an integer N≥2. Construct string S of length N containing only lowercase Latin alphabets, such that

S contains at least 2 distinct characters.
The number of circular shifts of S which are palindromes is maximum among all strings of length N containing at least 2 distinct characters.

If there are multiple possible strings satisfying this condition, you may print any of them.
Note that a string of length N has exactly N circular shifts - even if some of them might be equal as strings, they are considered to be different shifts as long as they are obtained by shifting S by different amounts. For example, ababab has 6 circular shifts even though they only form 2 distinct strings between them (namely ababab and bababa).
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing one integer N - the length of the string to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the string S you construct.
Note: You will get a Wrong Answer verdict if any of the following cases occur:

The length of the output string is not equal to N.
The output string has characters other than lowercase Latin alphabets, i.e, [a−z].
The output string has all characters the same.
There exists a string S′ of length N with at least 2 distinct characters, such that the output string has strictly fewer circular shifts being palindromes than S′ does.
