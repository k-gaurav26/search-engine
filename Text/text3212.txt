Problem
You are given a string S of length N, containing lowercase Latin letters. You are also given an integer K.
You would like to create a new string S′ by following the following process:

First, partition S into exactly K non-empty subsequences S1​,S2​,…,SK​. Note that every character of S must be present in exactly one of the Si​.
Then, create S′ as the concatenation of these subsequences, i.e, S′=S1​+S2​+…+SK​, where + denotes string concatenation.

Determine the lexicographically smallest S′ that can be created.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, N and K.
The second line of each test case contains the string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the lexicographically smallest string S′ that can be created.
