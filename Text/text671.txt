Problem
Vasya has ordered a pizza delivery. The pizza can be considered a perfect circle. There were n premade cuts in the pizza when it was delivered. Each cut is a straight segment connecting the center of the pizza with its boundary.
Let O be the center of the pizza, Pi​ be the endpoint of the i-th cut lying on the boundary, and R be the point of the boundary straight to the right of O. Then the counterclockwise-measured angle ∠ROPi​ is equal to ai​ degrees, where ai​ is an integer between 0 and 359. Note that angles between 0 and 180 angles correspond to Pi​ in the top half of the pizza, while angles between 180 and 360 angles correspond to the bottom half.
Vasya may cut his pizza a few more times, and the new cuts still have to be straight segments starting at the center. He wants to make the pizza separated into several equal slices, with each slice being a circular sector with no cuts inside of it. How many new cuts Vasya will have to make?
Input:
The first line of input contains T , i.e number of test cases per file.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n−  the numbers of premade cuts (2≤n≤360).
The second lines contains n integers a1​,…,an​− angles of the cuts 1,…,n respectively (0 \leq a_1 &lt; \ldots, a_{n - 1} \lt 360).
Output:
Print a single integer− the smallest number of additional cuts Vasya has to make so that the pizza is divided into several equal slices.
