Problem

An addition chain for a positive integer N is a sequence of positive integers C = (A0, A1, ..., AL) such that

1 = A0 < A1 < ... < AL – 1 < AL = N,
for each i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ L there exist integers j and k such that 0 ≤ j, k < i and Ai = Aj + Ak.



The integer L is called the length of the chain C.


For example, C = (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 15) is an addition chain of length 5 for N = 15. Indeed,


A0 = 1,
A1 = 2 = 1 + 1 = A0 + A0,
A2 = 3 = 2 + 1 = A1 + A0,
A3 = 6 = 3 + 3 = A2 + A2,
A4 = 12 = 6 + 6 = A3 + A3,
A5 = 15 = 3 + 12 = A2 + A4.


It is, in fact, the shortest addition chain for N = 15.


Your task is to find some addition chain for a given positive integer N.


The shorter chain you will find the better score you will get.

Input

The only line of the input file contains an integer N, the number for which you need to find an addition chain.

Output

The first line of the output file should contain an integer L ≤ 500, the length of your addition chain for the value of N given in the input file. L lines should follow. ith line should contain two non-negative integers j[i] and k[i] both less than i separated by exactly one space. Their meaning is that for your addition chain, Ai is equal to Aj[i] + Ak[i]. More specifically, your output will be considered as correct if and only if all of the following conditions hold:

1 ≤ L ≤ 500;
0 ≤ j[i], k[i] < i for all i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ L;
for the sequence  (A0, A1, ..., AL) defined by the rules A0 = 1 and Ai = Aj[i] + Ak[i] for i = 1, 2, ..., L we have 1 = A0 < A1 < ... < AL – 1 < AL = N.



Your program will get Accepted if and only if it returns correct output for each test case within a given time limit.

Scoring

Your score for a test file is the length of your addition chain, that is, an integer L. The total score for a submission is the average score across all test files. Your goal is to minimize the total score.
