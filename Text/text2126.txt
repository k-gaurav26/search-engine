Problem
Concatenation of two integers is obtained as follows: First, convert both integers to strings. Then concatenate both strings into one and convert this concatenated string back to integer.
For example, concatenation of 6 and 7 is CONC(6,7)=67, concatenation of 123 and 45 is CONC(123,45)=12345.
You are given an array A consisting of N integers. You are also given two integers L and R. Find the number of pairs (i, j) such that  1≤i,j≤N and   L≤CONC(Ai​,Aj​)≤R
Note: Since the size of the input and output is large, please use fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N,L,R.
The second line of each test case line contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of suitable pairs.
