Problem
Chef has two binary strings A and B, each of length N.  He can perform the following operation on A any number of times:

Choose L and R (1≤L≤R≤N), such that, in the substring A[L,R], the number of 1s is not equal to the number of 0s and reverse the substring A[L,R].

Find whether Chef can convert the string A into the string B by performing the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times on A.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N, the length of the binary strings.
The second line of each test case contains the string A.
The third line of each test case contains the string B.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if it is possible to convert the string A into the string B by performing any (possibly zero) number of given operations on A. Otherwise, print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).
