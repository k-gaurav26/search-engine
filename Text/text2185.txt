You are given a tree consisting of n nodes numbered from 1 to n. The weights of edges of the tree can be any binary integer satisfying following Q conditions.


		Each condition is of form u, v, x where u, v are nodes of the tree and x is a binary number. 
		For satisfying this condition,  sum of the weight of all the edges present in the path from node u to v of the tree, should have even if x = 0, odd otherwise. 
	



Now, you have to find out number of ways of assigning 0/1 (binary) weights to the edges of the tree satisfying the above conditions.
As the answer could be quite large, print your answer modulo 109 + 7.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.
For each test case:
	
First line contains two space separated integers n, Q.
Each of the next n - 1 lines will contain two space separated integer  u, v denoting that there is an edge between vertex u and v in the tree.
Each of the next Q lines will contain three space separated integer  u, v, x denoting a condition as stated in the probelm.



Output

For each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.
