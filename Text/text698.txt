Problem
You are given arrays A and B of length N each. Determine the number of good pairs.
A pair (i,j) (1≤i,j≤N) is said to be good if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

i<j;
Ai​=Bj​;
Aj​=Bi​;

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

Description of each test case:

First line contains an integer N - denoting the length of the arrays.
Second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…AN​ - denoting the array A.
Third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…BN​ - denoting the array B.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of good pairs.
