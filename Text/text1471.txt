Chef has a sequence A with length N and a line given by the equation y(x) = k · x + b. Let us say that an element Aj is reachable from another element Ai if the point (Ai, Aj) is lying above or on the line y(x), i.e. if Aj ≥  k · Ai + b.
Consider an arbitrary subsequence of A; let's denote it by B. Subsequence B is called good if its elements can be reordered in such a way that for each valid i, Bi+1 is reachable from Bi.
Chef asked you to compute the maximum possible length of a good subsequence. Can you help him?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, k and b.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the length of the longest good subsequence of A.
