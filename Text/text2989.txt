In an undirected unweighted graph, an edge of the graph is said to be lucky if it is a part of some cycle of the graph.
You are given a list E of M edges. We define f(i) as the number of intervals [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ i ≤ r ≤ M) such that if you build a graph from edges El, El+1, ..., Er, the edge Ei will be a lucky edge in this graph.
Your task is to calculate the values of f(1), f(2), ..., f(M).
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer M denoting the number of edges.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers ui and vi denoting that i-th edge connects nodes ui and vi.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing M integers, i-th of which should be value of f(i).
