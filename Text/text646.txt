Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given two integers L and R. Find the smallest non-negative integer N such that
N%L>N%(L+1)>…>N%(R−1)>N%R.
Here, % is the modulo operator, so A%B is the remainder of A after division by B. For example, 11%3=2.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest possible N, or −1 if no solution exists.
It is guaranteed that when a solution exists, the smallest solution does not exceed 1018.
