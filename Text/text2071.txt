Problem
Chef is again playing a game with his best friend Garry. As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon.
First, they are given a stack of N discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers  S of size K. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer 1. In a move, a player can select any value x from S and pop exactly x elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first.
Scoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by 2p where p is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers p1​,p2​,p3​,…,pm​ written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be 2p1​+2p2​+2p3​+⋯+2pm​.
The player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.
Input:

First line contains T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K, denoting the size of the stack and the set S respectively.
Next line contains N space separated integers Ai​ where A1​ is the topmost element, denoting the initial arrangement of the stack.
The last line of each test case contains K space separated integers each denoting xi​.

Output:
For each testcase, output "Chef" (without quotes) if Chef wins, "Garry" (without quotes) if Garry wins, otherwise "Draw" (without quotes) in a separate line.
