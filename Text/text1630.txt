There are N chairs placed in circular order. Some of the chairs are empty while others have a child sitting in it. You are required to change the places of the children so that all the children sit next to each other (i.e. they form a connected segment). You can do that by doing the following operation a number of times:

Choose a child and tell him to walk around the circle in clockwise order or anti-clockwise order until he finds the first empty chair, and tell him to sit there.

What is the minimum number of operations required to make all children sit next to each other?

Input

The first line contains T, the number of test-cases.

The first line of each test-case contains N, the number of chairs.
The second line of each test-case contains a binary string of length N. If the i-th character is 1 then the i-th chair has a child initially. Otherwise (i.e. the i-th character is 0) it's empty.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer donating minimum number of operations needed.
