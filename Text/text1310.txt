This is an interactive problem.
There is a sequence of positive integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. You do not know this sequence, but your task is to find the value of A1​⊕A2​⊕…⊕AN​, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
You may ask up to 20 questions. In each question, you should choose an integer K (1≤K≤2⋅106) and the interactor responds with the value of (A1​⊕K)+(A2​⊕K)+…+(AN​⊕K).
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer N.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and K, where 1≤K≤2⋅106. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to your question or −1 if the question is invalid or you asked more than 20 questions.
Finally, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 2 and X, where X=A1​⊕A2​⊕…⊕AN​. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer was correct or −1 if it was incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note that when you receive an answer −1, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
