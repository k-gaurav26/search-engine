Problem
Today is your birthday. You have decided to give away candies to your friends.
You have N friends and M candies. Suppose the 1st friend has L buckets, 2nd has L+1 buckets, 3rd has L+2 buckets, and so on — in general, the ith friend has L+i−1 buckets.
You start distributing candies from the Nth friend and go towards the 1st friend.
For each friend, you put the maximum number of candies in each bucket such that all the buckets for that friend have an equal number of candies in them. Now, you take the remaining candies, move to the next friend, and repeat the above step.
Find the number of candies which will remain with you after visiting all your friends.
Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers N,M,L — representing the number of friends, number of candies that you have, and the number of buckets with the 1st friend respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer representing the total number of candies left with you after distributing candies to all your friends.
