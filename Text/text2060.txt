Kefaa has developed a novel decomposition of a tree. He claims that this decomposition solves many difficult problems related to trees. However, he doesn't know how to find it quickly, so he asks you to help him.
You are given a tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N. Let's denote an edge between vertices u and v by (u,v). The triple-tree decomposition is a partition of edges of the tree into unordered triples of edges (a,b),(a,c),(a,d) such that a=b=c=d. Each edge must belong to exactly one triple.
Help Kefaa with this problem — find a triple-tree decomposition of the given tree or determine that no such decomposition exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing an edge between vertices u and v of the tree.

Output

For each test case, print a line containing the string "YES" if a triple-tree decomposition of the given tree exists or "NO" otherwise.
If it exists, print 3N−1​ more lines describing a decomposition.
Each of these lines should contain four space-separated integers a, b, c and d describing a triple of edges (a,b),(a,c),(a,d).

If more than one triple-tree decomposition exists, you may output any one.
