You are given two integer sequences A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and B1​,B2​,…,BN​ and an integer K. You may perform the following operation at most 3⋅N times:

Select a contiguous subsequence of A with length K. Let's denote this subsequence by AL​,AL+1​,…,AL+K−1​.
Create an integer sequence S1​,S2​,…,SK​ which is isomorphic to the selected subsequence ― for each pair of integers i and j (1≤i,j≤K), Si​=Sj​ must hold if AL−1+i​=AL−1+j​ and Si​=Sj​ must hold if AL−1+i​=AL−1+j​. In addition, 1≤Si​≤1,000 must hold for each valid i.
For each valid i, replace AL−1+i​ by Si​.

Is it possible to change the sequence A to B? If it is possible, find a sequence of operations which morphs A to B.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to morph A to B using no more than 3⋅N operations, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, start by printing a line containing the string "YES" (without quotes).
Then, print a line containing a single integer P (0≤P≤3⋅N) ― the number of operations you want to perform.
Finally, print P lines. Each of these lines should contain K+1 space-separated integers L,S1​,S2​,…,SK​ describing an operation (1≤L≤N−K+1; 1≤Si​≤1,000 for each valid i).

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
