Problem
You are given a connected undirected graph G = (V,E). We define a simple cycle to be Good, if it consists of an odd number of edges, and if on deleting all those edges, the graph still remains connected. Note that we do not delete any vertices.
A 4−Coloring of the graph is an assignment of colors to the vertices of the graph and which satisfies these properties:

Every vertex should be assigned exactly 1 color.
You can only use one of four colours: {1,2,3,4}.
There should be no edge(u,v) such that both u and v have been assigned the same color.

You should either find and output a Good cycle, or give a 4−Coloring of the entire graph. Note that the given graph might both of these and multiple instances of these. Any one of them can be printed. Also, you can prove that you can never have a graph which has neither of these.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer, T. This denotes the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers: N and M, which denote the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.
Each of the next M lines contains two integers, u and v, denoting that there is an edge between the nodes u and v.
Output
The first line of each testcase’s output should contain a single integer: 1 if you are going to print a 4−Coloring, and 2 if you are going to print a Good cycle.
If you had printed 1 in the previous line, then the second line should contain N space separated integers, each of which is one of {1, 2, 3, 4}. The i-th of these numbers should denote the color assigned to Node i in your 4−Coloring.
If you had printed 2 in the previous line, then first print the length of the Good cycle in the second line, and print the vertices in the cycle in order in the same line.
