Problem Statement
Chef has a undirected graph G. This graph consists of N vertices and M edges. Each vertex of the graph has an unique index from 1 to N, also each edge of the graph has an unique index from 1 to M.
Also Chef has Q pairs of integers: Li, Ri (1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ M). For each pair Li, Ri, Chef wants to know: how many connected components will contain graph G if Chef erase all the edges from the graph, except the edges with indies X, where Li ≤ X ≤ Ri. Please, help Chef with these queries. 
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers N, M, Q. Each of the next M lines contains a pair of integers Vi, Ui - the current edge of graph G. Each of the next Q lines contains a pair of integers Li, Ri - the current query.
Output
For each query of each test case print the required number of connected components.
