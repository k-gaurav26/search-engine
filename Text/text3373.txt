Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Sereja have an array A = [A1, A2, ..., AN], where N is an even integer. Let the function f(A) be defined by f(A) = |(A1 + A2 + ... + AN/2) − (AN/2+1 + AN/2+2 + ... + AN)|. Sereja want to decrease the value f(A) by the unusual way.
Let A[l..r] denote the sub-array [Al, Al+1, ..., Ar] of A. Sereja can shift some sub-array A[l..r], where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N, then the array A will become [A1, A2, ..., Al-1, Al+1, Al+2, ..., Ar, Al, Ar+1, Ar+2, ..., AN]. For example we have the array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and we choose  l = 2, r = 4, then after shifting we have the following array: A = [1, 3, 4, 2, 5].
Sereja can shift multiple times, however it's burdensome to shift many elements. Thus the sum of r − l + 1 should not exceed 2 × N.
Please help Sereja to find the way for decreasing the value f(A) = |(A1 + A2 + ... + AN/2) − (AN/2+1 + AN/2+2 + ... + AN)| as much as possible. Note that you don't have to minimize the value f(A), but the smaller value will give the higher score.
Input
Each test file contains only one test case.
The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the length of the array. Then the next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Output
The first line should contain an integer q, denoting the number of shifts. Then the kth line of the next q lines should contain two space-separated integers l and r, denoting the kth shift, where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N.
