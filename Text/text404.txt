A number is called palindromic if its decimal representation is a palindrome. You are given a range, described by a pair of integers L and R. Find the sum of all palindromic numbers lying in the range [L, R], inclusive of both the extrema.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a pair of space separated integers L and R denoting the range for which you are required to find the sum of the palindromic numbers. 
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the palindromic numbers in the given range.
