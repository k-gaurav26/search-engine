Chef Ada is training to defend her title of World Chess Champion.
To train her calculation skills, Ada placed a king on a chessboard. Remember that a chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns (for the purposes of this problem, both the rows and the columns are numbered 1 through 8); let's denote the square in row r and column c by (r,c). A king on a square (r,c) can move to another square (r′,c′) if and only if (r′−r)2+(c′−c)2≤2.
Ada placed her king on the square (R,C). Now, she is counting the number of squares that can be visited (reached) by the king in at most K moves. Help Ada verify her answers.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers R, C and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of squares the king can visit.
