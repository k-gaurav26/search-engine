Problem

For given two positive integers a and b let's construct the sequence x[1], x[2], ... by the following rules. For k=1 we put x[1]=1. Now let k >= 2. Then x[k] is the least positive integer such that the following two conditions hold
x[k] > x[k - 1];
 for all i, j < k we have x[k] is not equal to a * x[i] - b * x[j].

You need to find the first n terms of this sequence.
Remark. Let a=2 and b=1. Then we see that sequence x[1], x[2], ... does not contain any arithmetic progression of length three as its subsequence. This justifies the problem title.
Input

The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains three integers a, b and n.

Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the numbers x[1], x[2], ..., x[n] generated by the rules given in the problem statement and numbers a, b. Separate any two consecutive numbers in a line by a single space.
