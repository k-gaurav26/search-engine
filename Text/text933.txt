Chef has a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. This sequence has exactly 2N subsequences. Chef considers a subsequence of A interesting if its size is exactly K and the sum of all its elements is minimum possible, i.e. there is no subsequence with size K which has a smaller sum.
Help Chef find the number of interesting subsequences of the sequence A.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of interesting subsequences.
