Problem description.
Given a rooted tree with N nodes. Nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to N. Node 1 is the root. You need to add M nodes to it in the given order. All the nodes have values. Cost for adding a node A with value va to another node B with value vb is va*vb. There is an additional cost of y (so total cost of va*vb+y) if B has atleast x child nodes. After node A has been added to another node B it becomes a child of B.
After adding a node A to the tree, nodes next in list can be added to A also. You need to calculate the total minimal cost to add all M nodes in given order.
Input
The first line of input contains N. The second line of input contains N integers representing the values of nodes in order from node 1 to node N. N-1 lines follow, each line defines an edge. Each line has 2 integers, which says that those 2 nodes are connected.
Next line of input contains an integer Q, denoting the number of queries you need to answer. Each query consists of 2 lines. The first line of each query has 3 integers, M x y. The second line of each query has M integers representing the values of the nodes to be added in order.
Note that in each query, M nodes are added to the initial tree, and hence changes made in previous query should not be considered in later queries
Output
For each query, output a single line containing the minimal total cost to add all the nodes in given order.
