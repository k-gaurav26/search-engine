Miana and Serdenopis have guests for dinner tonight and thus they have prepared N pairs of slippers for their guests (who shall take off their shoes before entering the house).
The slippers are on a line and the i-th pair of slippers has size Si​.
When a guest enters, he takes the first pair of slippers which are still in the line (i.e., they are not taken by a previous guest) and are big enough for him (that is, the slippers' size must be larger or equal than his shoes' size) and does not touch any other pair of slippers. If he cannot find any fitting slippers, he does not take any pair of slippers.
Miana and Serdenopis do not remember how many guests they will have for dinner (and of course, they don't know their shoes' sizes either), but they are interested in the possible subsets of taken slippers.
A (possibly empty) subset of the slippers is interesting if there is a configuration of guests such that all the slippers in the subset are taken and all the slippers not in the subset are not taken.
Count the number of interesting subsets. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N, the number of pairs of slippers.
The second line contains N integers S1​,S2​,…,SN​, where the i-th pair of slippers in the line has size Si​.

Output Format
Print the number of interesting subsets modulo 998244353.
