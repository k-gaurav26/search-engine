Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given an integer A. Let's define an infinite sequence S(A)=A%P,A2%P,A3%P,â€¦, where P=108+7 is a prime and % is the modulo operator.
Let's also define a decreasing sum D(S) as the sum of all elements of a sequence S which are strictly smaller than all preceding elements of S. When S is a sequence of non-negative integers, the number of such elements is clearly finite.
Find D(S(A)).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer A.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer D(S(A)).
