Problem
Edward Elric is chasing after Scar. To stop Edward, Scar creates N barriers in the way, numbered from 1 to N.
Each barrier Scar created is either one of the following two types.

Type 1 barrier - This barrier starts from a height X above the ground and extends till the sky.
Type 2 barrier - This barrier starts from the ground and extends up to height X above the ground.

The height of Edward is H units and he has an alchemic life force of L units. Moreover, he can duck by Y1​ units and jump by height Y2​ units (as explained in the figures). He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier 1 till the barrier N. Whenever he can't pass a barrier by ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier. However, this costs him a single unit of his alchemic life force.
If after breaking a barrier no life force is left, Edward gets completely exhausted, unable to pass that barrier.
How many barriers can Edward cross?
And remember never to call him a pipsqueak if his height is too short!
         ### Input:


The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains five integers N, H, Y1​, Y2​ and L.
The i-th of the next N lines contains two integers ti​ and Xi​ for the ith barrier where ti​=1 denotes a Type 1 Barrier and ti​=2 denotes a Type 2 barrier.
Output:


For each test case print a single line containing the number of barriers Edward can pass.
