Problem
in every century, there is a chosen one. Therefore, we do not live in a society

K0Kalaru47 was out with his friends and he started to tell them about a CP Task. Because the statement was informal, his friends quickly parried with "Who Asked", so here is the formal statement:
Given arrays P and C of size (N+K) each, the beauty of an array B of size (N+K) is defined as the sum of Ci​ for all 1≤i≤(N+K) such that Bi​=Pi​.
More formally, the beauty of an array B is equal to ∑i=1∣B∣​Ci​ [Bi​=Pi​]
Given an array A of size N such that (1≤Ai​≤M).
Your task is to insert K elements into the array such that:

Each inserted element lies in the range [1,M].
The beauty of the final array is maximized.

Note that, an element can be inserted at any index of the array.
You should find two values:

The maximum beauty that can be obtained across all arrays of size (N+K).
The number of distinct arrays of size (N+K) having the maximum beauty. Note that, two arrays X and Y are said to be different if there exists some index i such that Xi​=Yi​. Since the number of distinct arrays can be huge, print the value modulo MOD.

Input Format

The first line of input consists of 4 integers N,K,M and MOD
The second line of input contains N space-separated integers - the array A.
The third line of input contains (N+K) space-separated integers - the array P.
The fourth line of input contains (N+K) space-separated integers - the array C.

Output Format
Print two integers separated by a single space.

The first integer corresponds to the maximum beauty that can be obtained across all arrays of size (N+K).
The second integer corresponds to the number of distinct arrays of size (N+K) having the maximum beauty. Since the number of distinct arrays can be huge, print the value modulo MOD.
