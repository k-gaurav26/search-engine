Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
For a given N, find the number of ways to choose an integer x from the range [0,2N−1] such that x⊕(x+1)=(x+2)⊕(x+3), where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.
Since the number of valid x can be large, output it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem modulo 109+7.
