The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:

The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0, because 0 does not belong to the array.
The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2, because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not.
The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 because 0,1,2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not.

Find the maximum possible MEX of an array of non-negative integers such that the bitwise OR of the elements in the array does not exceed X.
Input Format

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer X on a single line.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the maximum possible MEX of the array satisfying the given property.
