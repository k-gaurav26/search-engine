Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

You are given an array A of integers of size N. You will be given Q queries where each query is represented by two integers L, R. You have to find the gcd(Greatest Common Divisor) of the array after excluding the part from range L to R inclusive (1 Based indexing). You are guaranteed that after excluding the part of the array 
remaining array is non empty.
Input
First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.  
For each test case, first line will contain two space separated integers N, Q.  
 Next line contains N space separated integers denoting array A. 
For next Q lines, each line will contain a query denoted by two space separated integers L, R. 
Output
For each query, print a single integer representing the answer of that query.
