Our little chef is fond of doing additions/sums in his free time. Today, he has an array A consisting of N positive integers and he will compute prefix and suffix sums over this array.
He first defines two functions prefixSum(i) and suffixSum(i) for the array as follows. The function prefixSum(i) denotes the sum of first i numbers of the array. Similarly, he defines suffixSum(i) as the sum of last N - i + 1 numbers of the array.
Little Chef is interested in finding the minimum index i for which the value prefixSum(i) + suffixSum(i) is the minimum. In other words, first you should minimize the value of prefixSum(i) + suffixSum(i), and then find the least index i for which this value is attained.
Since, he is very busy preparing the dishes for the guests, can you help him solve this problem?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of integers in the array A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the array A.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.
