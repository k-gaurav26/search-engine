For a sequence of positive integers A1​,A2​,…,AK​, let's define the number of inversions in it as the number of pairs of integers (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤K and Ai​>Aj​.
You are given a permutation P1​,P2​,…,PN​ of the integers 1 through N. Determine if it is possible to partition this permutation into two subsequences (possibly empty or non-contiguous) such that:

Each element of P appears in exactly one of these subsequences.
The numbers of inversions in one subsequence is equal to the number of inversions in the other subsequence.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers P1​,P2​,…,PN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to partition the permutation in a given way or "NO" if it is impossible.
