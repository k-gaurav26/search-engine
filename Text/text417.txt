Chef likes strings a lot but he likes palindromic strings more. Today, Chef has two strings A and B, each consisting of lower case alphabets.


Chef is eager to know whether it is possible to choose some non empty strings s1 and s2 where s1 is a substring of A, s2 is a substring of B such that s1 + s2 is a palindromic string. Here '+' denotes the concatenation between the strings.
Note:
A string is a palindromic string if it can be read same both forward as well as backward. To know more about palindromes click here.
