One day, Chef prepared D brand new dishes. He named the i-th dish by a string Si. After the cooking, he decided to categorize each of these D dishes as special or not.


A dish Si is called special if it's name (i.e. the string Si) can be represented in the form of a double string by removing at most one (possibly zero) character from it's name from any position. 


A string is called a double string if it can be represented as a concatenation of two identical, non-empty strings. 
e.g. "abab" is a double string as it can be represented as "ab" + "ab" where + operation denotes concatenation. 
Similarly, "aa", "abcabc" are double strings whereas "a", "abba", "abc" are not.

Input

First line of the input contains an integer D denoting the number of dishes prepared by Chef on that day.
Each of the next D lines will contain description of a dish. 
	
The i-th line contains the name of i-th dish Si.
 	

Output
For each of the D dishes, print a single line containing "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) denoting whether the dish can be called as a special or not.
