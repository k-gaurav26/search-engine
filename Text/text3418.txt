Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
Find the number of sequences with K elements which satisfy the following conditions:

Each element is an integer between L and R inclusive.
The bitwise XOR of all elements is between A and B inclusive.

Since the number of sequences satisfying the given conditions can be quite large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers L, R, A, B and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of valid sequences modulo 998,244,353.
