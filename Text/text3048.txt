Problem
Alice and Bob are given an array of length of N. They decide to play a game with it.
Initially, Alice randomly shuffles the array, and then Bob takes N turns. In each turn, Bob chooses an index which he has not already chosen and then Alice reveals the number on that index to Bob. If this number is either the first number to be chosen or strictly larger than previously chosen numbers by Bob then he takes it and adds to his array else he throws it.
You only know the initial unshuffled array and want to know the expected length of Bob's array at the end of the game.
The final expected length can be represented as a fraction of the form QP​. You are required to print P⋅Q−1mod998244353.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input.
The first line contains N the length of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,...,AN​ representing the initial array.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the expected length of Bob's array at the end of the game modulo 998244353.
