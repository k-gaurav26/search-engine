Problem
You are given a binary string S of length N.
Let G be a complete directed graph of N vertices numbered from 1 to N. There is a directed edge going from vertex u to v if one of the following is true:

Su​=Sv​ and u<v
Su​=Sv​ and u>v

For example, if S=1010 then G looks like this:


You will be given Q queries of two different types:

1 L R - Flip all the bits in S in range [L,R] and update G accordingly.
2 L R X - Find whether there is a path that starts from vertex X and visits each vertex in G[L,R] exactly once (a hamiltonian path in other words).

G[L,R] is the subgraph induced by the vertices in the range [L,R] and the edges connecting them. For example, if S=1010 then G[2,4] consists of the vertices 2, 3, and 4, and the three edges 2→4, 4→3, and 3→2.
Input Format

The first line contains two integers, N and Q.
The second line contains a binary string S of length N.
The ith line of the next Q lines contains the description of the ith query.

Output Format
For each query of type 2, print a single line containing YES if there's a hamiltonian path starting from vertex X, or NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).
