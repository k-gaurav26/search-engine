Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given positive integers L and R. You have to find the sum
S=∑i=LR​(L∧(L+1)∧…∧i),
where ∧ denotes the bitwise AND operation. Since the sum could be large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum S modulo 109+7.
