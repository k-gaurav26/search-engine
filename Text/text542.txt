Problem
You are given an array A containing N positive integers. Find the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and:
Ai​+Aj​≥Ai​⋅Aj​
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the required answer.
