Problem
You are given an integer sequence A=(A1​,A2​,…,AN​) of length N and an integer M such that 0≤M<i=1∑N​Ai​.
An integer sequence B=(B1​,B2​,…,BN​) of length N is called good if:

0≤Bi​≤Ai​ for each 1≤i≤N
B1​+B2​+⋯+BN​=M

Find the maximum value of gcd(A1​−B1​,A2​−B2​,…,AN​−BN​) over all good sequences B. Here, gcd denotes  the greatest common divisor.
Note: gcd(a,b,c)=gcd(a,gcd(b,c)) and gcd(a,0)=gcd(0,a)=a.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,M.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum value of gcd(A1​−B1​,A2​−B2​,…,AN​−BN​) over all good sequences B.
