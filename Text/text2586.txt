Problem
Consider a positive integer N. Denote its decimal digits by X1, X2,..., XK. N is called a Cool Number if you can select at most three (but at least one) of its digits such that the following number is divisible by N:
(X1 + X2 + ... + XK – S)S
where S is the sum of the selected digits.
Let LC(N) be the largest Cool Number which is not greater than N, and UC(N) be the smallest Cool Number which is greater than N. So the following inequalities hold
 LC(N) ≤ N < UC(N).
Your task is to find for the given positive integer N the values of LC(N) and UC(N). As you will see from the examples LC(N) and UC(N) exist for every positive integer N.
Consider some examples.

1458 is a Cool Number since ((1 + 4 + 5 + 8) – (1 + 5))1 + 5 = 126 = 2985984 is divisible by 1458. Note that here we select two digits: 1 and 5.
All numbers of the form 10n (n = 0, 1, 2, ...) are Cool. Indeed, if we select just one digit 1 (the first digit of 10n) in the definition of Cool Number we obtain the number (1 + 0 + ... + 0 – 1)1 = 01 = 0 and it is divisible by 10n (recall that 0 is divisible by every positive integer). Now consider some positive integer N of n digits. Then, clearly, 10n-1 ≤ N < 10n where both 10n-1 and 10n are Cool Numbers. Hence LC(N) and UC(N) always exist and, moreover, LC(N) ≥ 10n-1 and UC(N) ≤ 10n.

Input
The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains a positive integer N.
Output
For each test case output on a single line values of LC(N) and UC(N) separated by a single space.
