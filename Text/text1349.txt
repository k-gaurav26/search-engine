Problem
Aujasvit just came up with a new game to play with his friends. N people stand in a circle, each assigned an index from 1 to N in clockwise order. Then the following operation is done N−1 times.

The person with the lowest index holds a coin.
Then, the coin then moves to the next person clockwise M−1 times.
Then, the person who is holding the coin is removed from the circle.

The last person remaining after N−1 operations is the winner.
Aujasvit has already decided on the integer M to be used in the game. Before inviting people to play his game, Aujasvit wants to know the winner if the game has 1 player, 2 players, 3 players, ..., X players. That is, you need to output the winner when N=1,N=2,...,N=X.
Input Format

The first line of each input contains T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers M and X.

Output Format
For each testcase, output X integers A1​,A2​,…,AX​, where Ai​ is the index of the winner if i people are playing this game.
