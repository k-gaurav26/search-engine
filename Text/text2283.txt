Sereja and Arrays 
Sereja have an array that consist of n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]. Also Sereja have an array that consist of m integers b[1], b[2], ..., b[m]. Sereja make next operations:
 
- random_shuffle(b) — shuffle elements of b
 
- random_merge(a, b) — merge array a and b to array a. From all possible merges Sereja chooses a random one. For better understanding you can imagine, that merged array is sequence q of n+m elements, each element if either zero or one. It contains exactly n zeroes and m ones. Then zeroes are replaced with elements of a, and ones are replaced with elements of b (without changing their relative order inside initial sequences).
 
Now Sereja want to know expected number of inversions in array a after described operations. Inversion is a pair (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n + m) such that a[i] > a[j].
Input
First line contain number T — number of testcases. T tests follow. First line of each testcase contain two integers n and m. Next line contain n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]. Next line contain m integers b[1], b[2], ..., b[m].

Output
For each testcase print expected number of inversions.
