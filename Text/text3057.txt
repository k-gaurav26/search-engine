Let's define a function P(x,y)=(x−y)2. For given real numbers a and b, let's define a polynomial Qa,b​(x)=P(P(P(x,a),a−b),x−b).
Next, let's define a function F(a,b):

If Qa,b​(x) has no real roots, F(a,b)=0.
Otherwise, let r be the largest real root of Qa,b​(x).
If r is rational, it can be represented by a fraction r=qp​, where p and q are coprime integers and q>0. Then, F(a,b)=p+q.
If r is irrational, it can be proved that in this case, it can be represented in the form r=qp+z​​, where p, q and z are integers, q>0 and z>0. Choose the representation with the smallest value of q (it is guaranteed to be unique in this case). Then, F(a,b)=p+z+q.

You are given a sequence of integers c1​,c2​,…,cN​. Find ∑i=1N​∑j=1N​F(ci​,cj​).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers c1​,c2​,…,cN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum of F(ci​,cj​).
