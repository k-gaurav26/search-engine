Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Sereja has a permutation P of the N numbers in the range 1 to N. You have to answer M queries over it, where each query is given four numbers l1, r1, l2, r2 (1 ≤ l1 ≤ r1 < l2 ≤ r2 ≤ N, r1 - l1 = r2 - l2). Your task is to calculate number of permutations Q of the S integers in the range 1 to S, such that S = r1 - l1 + 1, and for each i from 1 to S, the condition PQi + l1 - 1 < Pi + l2 - 1 is satisfied.
Please help Sereja in providing the answer for each query modulo 109 + 7.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M.
Next line contains numbers P1, P2, ..., PN.
Each of next M lines contains numbers l1, r1, l2, r2 - denoting the query.
Output
For each query, output the corresponding answer in single line.
