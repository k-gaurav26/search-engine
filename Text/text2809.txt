Problem
“You can make a lot by playing such games.”
Every player has to play a game of Ddakji with the recruiter in order to enter the squid game. Gi-Hun has played many rounds but was unable to win even once. The recruiter thus decided to give him a puzzle instead.
Gi-Hun is given an array A of N elements.
He can perform the following operation on array A any number of times:

Select any two indexes 1≤i,j≤N such that i=j and replace Ai​ with Ai​−Aj​.

His task is to find the minimum possible value of ∣A1​∣+∣A2​∣+…+∣AN​∣ attainable by performing these operations several (possibly, 0) times.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains N, the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers — A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, print on a new line one integer — minimum possible value of ∣A1​∣+∣A2​∣+…+∣AN​∣.
