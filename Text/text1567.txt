Problem
Nathan is preparing for the Dash marathon. He has N training plans. The i-th plan has an effectiveness of Ai​, but requires that at least Bi​ other training plans must be performed before it. A training plan cannot be repeated.
If he performs some K>0 distinct trainings - P1​,P2​,…,PK​ (1≤Pi​≤N,Pi​=Pj​) then his training score is K∑j=1K​APj​​​. If Nathan does not perform any training plan (K=0), then his score is 0.
What is the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans, if he can perform them in any order?
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains N - the number of training plans.
The second line contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ where Ai​ is the effectiveness of the i-th training plan.
The third line contains N integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​ where Bi​ is the number of pre-requisite training plans for the i-th training plan.

Output Format

For each test case, output a single real number - the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6.
Formally, let your answer be X, and the jury's answer be Y. Your answer is accepted if and only if max(1,∣Y∣)∣X−Y∣​≤10−6.
