Given an array A consisting of N integers - A1, A2....AN. You have to find the value of 
Σ MAX(i,j) * F(i,j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N.


MAX(i,j) is defined as max(Ai,Ai+1...Aj).

F(i,j) is defined as: 

F(i,j) will be 1 if (Ai&Aj) = Aj or (Ai&Aj) = Ai

 F(i,j) will be 0, otherwise.
    

Here & denotes the bitwise AND operator.

Input
The first line of input will consist of integer N.
The next line of input will consists of N integers A1, A2....AN.
Output
Output the value of the above mentioned expression in a single line.
