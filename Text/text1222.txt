Problem
You are given an array B of length 2N . You have an unknown array A which is sorted and contains distinct elements. You need to find out the array A. B contains all the medians of each prefix and suffix of the array A.
A median is the middle element in a sorted array . [1,2,3,4] has median 2 and [1,3,4] has 3 as median.
Determine whether B is a valid array of some array A. If yes find the array A else print −1.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains 2N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the valid array A or −1 if not possible.
