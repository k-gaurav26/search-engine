There are three combos A, B, and C available at the counter. You are given the time (in minute) for which each Popcorn bucket and Coke cup lasts. Given that Vishesh's satisfaction from a combo is defined as the total lasting time (in minute) of the Popcorn bucket and the Coke cup, find the maximum satisfaction he can get by buying a single combo.
