Problem
Chef lives in Treeland which, as the name implies, is shaped like a tree.
Chef's home, his school, and the playground where he likes to play are located on three different vertices in this tree. Chef tells you that every morning he walks across x edges on the simple path from his home to his school. In the afternoon, he walks along the simple path from his school to the playground crossing y edges. And in the evening, he walks back home across z edges on the simple path from the playground to his home.
You have a map of Treeland where each vertex is labelled from 1 to n. Find the number of triplets (a,b,c) such that vertices a,b,c could be Chef's home, his school and the playground respectively. If there is no such triplet, Chef may have miscounted some edges and you should output 0.
Input

The first line contains t, the number of test cases. t cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains four integers n,x,y,z.
nâˆ’1 lines follow, each with a pair of integers u and v denoting that there is an edge between u and v.

Output

For each testcase, output a single line containing the number of triplets which satisfy Chef's description.
