Problem
Chef has an array A containing N integers. The integers of the array can be positive, negative, or even zero.
Chef allows you to choose at most K elements of the array and multiply them by −1.
Find the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain if you choose the elements of the subsequence optimally.
Note: A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4]. Note that empty sequence is also a subsequence.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,...,AN​

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain.
