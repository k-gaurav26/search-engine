Problem
There are two merchants in the market. Initially, the first merchant has N items for sale at distinct prices A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and the second merchant has M items for sale at distinct prices B1​,B2​,…,BM​.
If you buy an item from a merchant, the prices of all remaining items for both merchants change in the following manner:

The cost of all the remaining items of the chosen merchant will increase by 1.
The cost of all the remaining items of the other merchant will decrease by 1.

Note that prices may become negative during this process.
For e.g. if A=[3,4,5],B=[1,3,4] and you buy the second item from the second merchant then the prices of remaining items will be as follows A=[2,3,4],B=[2,−,5]
You can only buy an item if its cost is at most C. Can you buy all items from both merchants in the market in some order?
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N, M and C - the number of items of the first merchant, the number of items of the second merchant and the maximum cost of an item you can buy respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​<A2​<⋯<AN​ - the prices of items of first merchant.
The third line contains M space-separated integers B1​<B2​<⋯<BM​ - the prices of items of second merchant.

Output Format
For each test case, output Yes if it is possible to buy all items from both merchants in the market in some order. Otherwise, output No.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).
