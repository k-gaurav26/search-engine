In a cricket game, an over is a set of six valid deliveries of balls performed by one player ― the bowler for this over.
Consider a cricket game with a series of N overs (numbered 1 through N) played by K players (numbered 1 through K). Each player may be the bowler for at most L overs in total, but the same player may not be the bowler for any two consecutive overs. Assign exactly one bowler to each over in such a way that these rules are satisfied or determine that no such assignment exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and L.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no valid assignment of bowlers to overs, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the number of the player assigned as the bowler for the i-th over.
