Problem
In Chefland, there are N houses numbered from 1 to N, ith house has a defence system having strength Ai​.
Chef suspects a bomb drop on one of the houses very soon. A bomb with attack strength X can destroy the ith house, if the defence system of the ith house Ai​, is strictly less than X.
Also, when the ith house is destroyed due to the bomb, all houses with indices j such that 1≤j<i get destroyed as well irrespective of their defence system.
Given one bomb with attack strength X, find the maximum number of houses that can get destroyed.
