Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
 
Sereja have array A' that contain N integers. Now Sereja want to permute elements of the array, he want to use some permutation p, such that A[i] = A'[p[i]], where A - new array. 
 
Lets function f(A,i) = S - A[i] - A[i +1] - ... - A[j], where j is the maximum possible index, such that A[i] + A[i + 1] + ... + A[j] <= S, if A[i] > S, f(A, i) = S.
 
Help Sereja to find such permutation p, such that (f(A, 1) + f(A, 2) + ... f(A, k))/k will be as low as possible. 
Input
 
First line of input contain integer T - number of testcases. Next lines contain T testcases. First line of each testcase contain three integers N, k, S. Next line contain N integers - array A'.
 
Output
 
For each testcase output N numbers in one line - permutation p.
