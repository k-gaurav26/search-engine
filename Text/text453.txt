Problem
You are given a binary string S of length N.
You have to perform the following operation exactly once:

Select an index i (1≤i≤N) and delete Si​ from S. The remaining parts of S are concatenated in the same order.

How many distinct binary strings of length N−1 can you get after applying this operation?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains N - the length of the binary string S.
The second line contains the binary string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct binary strings that you can get after applying the operation exactly once.
