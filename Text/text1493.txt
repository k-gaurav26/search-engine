Problem
An array is said to be good if all its elements are distinct, i.e. no two elements of the array are equal to each other.
You are given a positive integer N and an integer K such that N≤K≤(2N+1​).
Construct an array A of length N that satisfies the following conditions

A has exactly K good (contiguous) subarrays, and
Every element of A is an integer from 1 to N (both inclusive).

If there are multiple such arrays, you can print any of them.
Note: It can be shown that for all inputs satisfying the given constraints, there is always a valid solution.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of testcases. The description of the T testcases follow.
Each testcase consists of a single line with two space separated integers, N and K respectively.

Output Format

For each testcase print N space separated integers, the elements of the constructed array.
If there are multiple outputs, you can print any of them.
Your output will be considered correct only if the following conditions are satisfied,

Every element of the array is between 1 and N, and
The array has exactly K good subarrays
