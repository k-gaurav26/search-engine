Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You are given a permutation A of the first N positive integers. You are also given Q queries to perform one-by-one, the i-th is defined by a pair Xi Yi and has the meaning that you swap the Xi-th number in the permutation with the Yi-th one. After performing each query you should output the number of inversions in the obtained permutation, modulo 2.
The inversion is such a pair (i, j) that i < j and Ai > Aj.
Input
The first line of input contains two space separated integers N and Q - the size of the permutation and the number of queries.
The second line contains N space separated integers - the permutation A.
Then there are Q lines. The i-th line contains two space separated integers - Xi and Yi, denoting the i-th query.
Output
Output Q lines. Output the number of inversions in the permutation (modulo 2) after performing the first i queries on the i-th line.
