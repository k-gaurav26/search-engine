A tuple (a,b,c) is considered good if it consists of three prime numbers a, b and c such that a<b<c≤N and a+b=c.
Two tuples are considered different if they differ in at least one position. Given N, find the number of good tuples that can be formed by integers from 1 to N.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The following T lines contain a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good tuples which can be formed using integers from 1 to N.
