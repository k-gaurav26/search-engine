Problem

Did you know that the Hindus believe there are 330 million deities ? Lets discuss about them in long contests. The three main forces of god Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, also called Trimurti ( 3 forms ), want to decide when to end the world. Given an array A, which contains the 'Good' ( or 'Evil' ) score of each place on earth, they can easily find the maximum sum of the scores of a (contiguous) sub-array of places. But this is not much useful to them. So, each of them gives a value K and want to know the Kth maximum sum of scores of a contiguous sub-array. In other words, find the value of S[K] (1-based index), where the array S contains the sums of all possible contiguous sub-arrays in non-increasing order.
Input

First line contains T, number of test cases. T cases follow. In each test case, first line contains N K1 K2 K3. Next line contains N space separated integers.
Output

For each test case, output the K1th, K2th and K3th maximum sum in a single line, separated by a single space. See sample cases and explanation for more clarity.
