Problem
Chef has a string S consisting only of English lowercase letters (a - z). However, Hitesh does not like it and wants it to be reversed.
Hitesh wonders what is the minimum number of operations required to reverse the string S using the following operation:

Select any i such that 1≤i≤∣S∣ and remove Si​ from its original position and append it to the end of the string (i.e. shift any character to the end of the string).

For e.g. if S= abcde and we apply operation on i=2, then S becomes acdeb.
Help Hitesh find the minimum number of operations required to reverse S.
It is guaranteed that it is possible to reverse the string in a finite number of operations.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer  T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T  test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing the string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to reverse the string S.
