Problem
You are given a binary square matrix A of size N×N. Let the value at cell (i,j) be denoted by A(i,j).
Your task is to count the number of square frames present in the grid. A square frame is defined to be a square submatrix of A whose border elements are all '1'.
Formally,

A square submatrix of A of size k with top-left corner (i,j) is defined to be the set of cells {(i+x,j+y)∣0≤x,y<k}. Note that this requires i+k−1≤N and j+k−1≤N.
A square frame of size k with top-left corner (i,j) is defined to be a square submatrix of size k such that A(i+x,j+y)= 1 whenever x=0 or y=0 or x=k−1 or y=k−1. There is no constraint on the values of elements strictly inside the frame.

Refer to the sample explanation for more details.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the grid.
Each of the next N lines contains a string consisting of N characters. The i-th such string represents the i-th row of A. Each character of each string is either 0 or 1.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the count of square frames in the grid.
