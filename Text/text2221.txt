Problem
"Don't Drink and Drive, but when you do, Better Call Saul."
Once Jesse and Walter were fighting over extra cash, and Saul decided to settle it with a game of stone piles whose winner gets the extra money. The game is described as follows :
There are N piles of stones with A1, A2, ... AN stones in each pile.
Jesse and Walter move alternately, and in one move, they remove one pile entirely.
After a total of X moves, if the Sum of all the remaining piles is odd, Walter wins the game and gets the extra cash, else Jesse is the winner.
Walter moves first.
Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.
Input:

The first line will contain T, number of testcases. T testcases follow :
The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers N,X.
The second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ...,AN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Jesse" (without quotes), if Jesse wins the game or "Walter" (without quotes) if Walter wins.
