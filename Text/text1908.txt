Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You have a rectangular grid of size N × M, namely, there are cells (x, y) for 1 ≤ x ≤ N, 1 ≤ y ≤ M. Two cells are adjacent if they share a side. More formally, two cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2) are adjacent if |x1 − x2| + |y1 − y2| = 1. Between two adjacent cells there can be a wall. Two cells a and b are connected if there is a way between them (in other words there is a sequence of cells c1, c2, ..., ck that c1 = a, ck = b, and for each 1 ≤ i < k, ci, ci+1 are adjacent cells without wall between them).
Now you are given Q queries, each of whom is of following four types.

1 x y - build the wall between cells (x, y) and (x, y+1). If there is already exist a wall between them, this query is ignored.
2 x y - build the wall between cells (x, y) and (x+1, y). If there is already exist a wall between them, this query is ignored.
3 x1 y1 x2 y2 - check if cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are connected. You must answer 1 if they are connected, 0 otherwise.
4 - You must answer the size of the largest connected component. A connected component is a set of sells wherein each two cells are connected. The size of a connected component is a number of the cells in it.

You must assume that there are no walls on the grid before the queries.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and Q, denoting the grid sizes and amount of queries. For next Q lines, each line contains a query. The format of queries are the same as described by the statement.
Output
For each test case, output an integer, denoting the sum of answers for queries of type 3 and 4. Note that you just print only the sum of the answers for each test case.
