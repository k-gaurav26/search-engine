Chef's team is going to participate at the legendary math battles. One of the main task in the competition is to calculate the number of ways to create a number by adding some Chefonacci numbers. A number is called a Chefonacci number if it is an element of Chefonacci sequence defined as follows.

f(0) = 1; 
f(1) = 2; 
For i > 1 : f(i) = f(i - 1) + f(i - 2)




Chef asked you to help him with this task. There will be Q question of form X, K : How many different ways are there to create X by adding K Chefonacci numbers. Note that the order of numbers in the addition does not matter, i.e. (f(i) + f(j) + f(k)) and (f(j) + f(i) + f(k)) will not be counted as distinct ways. Also note that you are allowed to use a Chefonacci number any number of times (zero or more).


As the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007).

Input

First line of the input contains an integer Q denoting number of questions Chef was asked.


In the next Q lines follow the questions, i-th of the line will denote the i-th question represented by two space separated integer X, K respectively.

Output

For each question, output a separate line containing the answer of the question.
