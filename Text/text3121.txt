Problem
A permutation of length N is an array of N integers such that every integer between 1 and N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once.
Chef creates a set from a permutation (P1​,P2​,…,PN​) of length N, as follows:

Initially Chef takes a empty set S=ϕ, and then for every index i(1≤i≤N), Chef insert a pair of integers (li​,ri​) into S, where 1≤li​≤ri​≤N and (Pli​​,Pli​+1​,…,Pri​​) denotes the longest subsegment of the permutation with Pi​ as the maximum element.

Note:

The elements of the set S are always distinct.
Two pairs (li​,ri​) and (lj​,rj​) are same only if li​=lj​ and ri​=rj​.

For example, if the permutation is (2,3,4,1), Chef creates the following set S={(1,1),(1,2),(1,4),(4,4)}.
You are given a set T containing N distinct pairs of integers. Find the number of different permutations of length N from which Chef can create a set S, which is equivalent to set T. Since the number can be very large, print it modulo (109+7).
Two sets S and T are considered equivalent if:

∣S∣=∣T∣, where ∣S∣ denotes the size of set S.
Every element of S is present in T, i.e, for each (li​,ri​)∈S,(li​,ri​)∈T.

Note that the elements of the set T may not be given in a particular order.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the size of set T.
Each of the next N lines contains a pair of integers (li​,ri​), denoting the set T.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of valid permutations, modulo (109+7).
