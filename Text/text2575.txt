Chef has two n × m matrices A and B. He wants to make them completely identical, to achieve this goal, he can perform the following actions in a single move:


Choose one of the matrices, either A or B.
Choose either one row or one column of the selected matrix.
Increment all the numbers in the selected row or column by 1.


Now Chef is wondering, what is the minimal number of moves he has to perform in order to make matrices A and B equal? Or is it just impossible?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line of input contains two integers n and m. 
The following n lines contain m space separated integers each ― the matrix A. 
The next n lines contain m space separated integers each ― the matrix B. 
Warning! The size of the input file can be up to 10 MB!
Output
For each test case, output a single integer ― the minimal number of moves Chef has to perform in order to make matrices A and B equal or -1 if this is not possible.
