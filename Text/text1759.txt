Problem
You are given an array B containing N integers, each of which is either −1 or a non-negative integer. Construct any integer array A of length N such that:

0≤Ai​≤109 for every 1≤i≤N
If Bi​≥0, A must satisfy mex(A1​,A2​,…,Ai​)=Bi​
Otherwise, Bi​=−1, which means there is no constraint on mex(A1​,A2​,…,Ai​)

If there does not exist any array satisfying the constraints, print −1 instead.
Note: The mex of a set of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to it. For example, mex(1,2,3)=0,mex(0,2,4,1)=3, and mex(0,0,0)=1.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of T testcases follows.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer N.
The second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the required answer on a new line: −1 if no valid array exists, or N space-separated integers denoting the elements of any valid array A. The elements of A must satisfy 0≤Ai​≤109.
