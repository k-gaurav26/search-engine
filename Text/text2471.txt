Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You are given an 1-based array A and its fixed parameters: R, p1, p2. You need to mantain this array, performing some operations. The operations are as follows:


0 S D X Y
Add an AGP with the start term of S, the common difference of D, common ratio of R from the X-th to the to Y-th element of A.
In other words: add S , (S+D)*R , (S+2D)*R2 ,....., (S+(Y-X)*D)*RY-X respectively to A[X], A[X+1], ..., A[Y].


1 X g
Replace the value of A[X] to (A[X])g modulo p2.
In other words: A[x] = (A[X])g modulo p2.


2 X Y
Report the sum of elements in A from the X-th to the Y-th modulo p1.
In other words: output  (A[X] + ...... + A[Y]) modulo p1.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 5 single space separated integers: N, Q, R, p1, p2).
The next line contains N single space separated integers (each is between 0 and 100000 inclusive).
Then, there are Q lines denoting the queries in the format, described above.
Output
For each query of the type 2 output the sum of all elements of A from the X-th to the Y-th modulo p1.
