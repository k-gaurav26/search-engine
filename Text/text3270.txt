Problem
Chef JJ is a fan of random events and calculating probabilities.
He designed a machine called the binary string randomizer (BSRand). BSRand takes a binary string A (say, of length N) as input and then generates a binary string B (of the same length N) as output using the following algorithm:
For each i from 1 to N,

Uniformly randomly choose an integer j between 1 and N.
Uniformly randomly choose an integer k between 1 and N.
Set Bi​:=Aj​⊕Ak​ (where ⊕ represents the bitwise XOR operation)

Given a binary string A, Chef JJ passes it through BSRand T times (i.e, first he passes the binary string A through the BSRand, then he passes the resultant binary string through BSRand again, and so on. This is done T times in total). Calculate the probability that the final binary string obtained is B.
You need to print the probability of getting binary string B modulo 998244353. Formally, let M=998244353. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction qp​, where p and q are integers and q≡0(modM). Output p⋅q−1(modM). In other words, output the (unique) integer x which satisfies 0≤x<M and x⋅q≡p(modM).
Input Format

The first line of the input contains two integers N and T - the length of the binary strings A and B and the number of times chef JJ passes the binary string through BSRand, respectively.
The second line contains the binary string A.
The third line contains the binary string B.

Output Format
Output the probability of getting binary string B from binary string A after passing it through BSRand T times, modulo 998244353.
