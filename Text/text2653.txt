Problem
There are N enemies standing from left to right with strengths S1​,S2​,…,SN​.
M bullets are to be fired from the left side such that only one bullet is fired at a time. The ith bullet (1≤i≤M) has power Pi​ and capacity Ci​.
This means that the ith bullet affects the first Ci​ alive enemies from the left side and decreases the strength of each of those Ci​ enemies by Pi​.
Once an enemy’s strength becomes less than or equal to 0, the enemy dies and its strength becomes 0.
Find the strength of all the enemies after all M bullets are fired.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers S1​,S2​,…,SN​, denoting strength of the enemies.
The third line contains M space-separated integers P1​,P2​,…,PM​, denoting the power of the ith bullet.
The fourth line contains M space-separated integers C1​,C2​,…,CM​, denoting the capacity of the ith bullet.

Output Format
For each test case, output N space-separated integers denoting the final strength of the enemies.
