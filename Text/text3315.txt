Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given two arrays of positive integers, A and B, both of length N. You must choose a sequence of N non-increasing real numbers R1​,R2​,…RN​ to multiply with B1​,B2​,…BN​ respectively, such that the sum of the squares of their differences with corresponding terms A1​,A2​,…AN​ is minimized.
Formally, find the minimum possible value of i=1∑N​(Ai​−Ri​Bi​)2, over all possible N-tuples of real numbers R=(R1​,R2​,…RN​) satisfying R1​≥R2​≥⋯≥RN​
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the length of arrays A and B.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…AN​.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…BN​.

Output
For each test case, print the minimum possible value of the objective as described in the statement.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6.
