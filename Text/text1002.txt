Problem
An index i in a permutation P of length N is said to be good if:

Pi​ is divisible by i

You are given 2 integers N and K. You need to construct a permutation P of length N such that exactly K indices in that permutation are good.
If no such permutation exists, output −1.
If multiple such permutations exist, output any.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and K - the length of the permutation to be constructed and the number of good indices.

Output Format
For each test case, output any permutation satisfying the given condition.
