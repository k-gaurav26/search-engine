Problem
Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
Appy and Chef are participating in a contest. There are N problems in this contest; each problem has a unique problem code between 1 and N inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to split the problems to solve between them ― Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by A but not divisible by B, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by B but not divisible by A (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible by both A and B).
To win, it is necessary to solve at least K problems. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, A, B and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Win" if they can solve at least K problems or "Lose" otherwise (without quotes).
