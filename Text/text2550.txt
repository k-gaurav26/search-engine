Problem
JJ has a binary string S of length N. JJ can perform the following operation on S:

Select an i such that 1≤i≤N, and flip Si​ (i.e. change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0)

JJ wants to minimize the number of inversions in S by performing the above operation at most K times. Can you help JJ do so?
Recall that a pair of indices (i,j) in S is called an inversion if i<j and Si​>Sj​.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K - the length of the binary string S and the maximum number of times JJ can perform the given operation.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N containing 0s and 1s only.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of inversions possible after performing the given operation at most K times.
