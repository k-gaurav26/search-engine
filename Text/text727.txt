You are given an integer C. Let d be the smallest integer such that 2d is strictly greater than C.
Consider all pairs of non-negative integers (A,B) such that A,B<2d and A⊕B=C (⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation). Find the maximum value of A⋅B over all these pairs.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer C.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible product A⋅B.
