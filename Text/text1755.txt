Chef always likes to play with arrays. He came up with a new term "magical subarray". A subarray is called magical if its starting index is 1 (1-based indexing). Now, Chef has an array of N elements and 2 types of queries:

type 1: Given two numbers i and x, the value at index i should be updated to x.
type 2: Given two numbers i and k, your program should output the total number of magical subarrays with the last index â‰¤ i in which the xor of all elements is equal to k.


Input

The first line of the input contains two integers N and Q denoting the number of elements in the array and the number of queries respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2 ... AN denoting the initial values of the array.
Each of the following Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is 1, it means that the operation is of type 1 and it will be followed by two integers i and x. If the first integer is 2, it means that the operations is of type 2 and it will be followed by two integers i and k.

Output
For each operation of type 2, print the number of magical subarrays on a separate line.
