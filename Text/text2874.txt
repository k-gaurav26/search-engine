Chef has a tree with N nodes numbered 1 through N. Initially, each node has value 0.
Chef's best friend Leonardo loves queries on trees. He asked Chef to perform Q queries. Each query is of one of the following two types:

 1 v k a b: Consider f(0) = a, f(1) = b, f(i) = f(i - 1) + f(i - 2) for i ≥ 2. For each node u of the tree, let d be the distance (in edges) from v to u. Then, if d ≤ k, Chef must add f(d) to the value of node u. 
 2 v: Print the value of node v modulo 10^9 + 7.


Help Chef perform Leonardo's queries! 
Input

The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
Each of the next N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting an edge between nodes x and y.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines describes one query in the format above.

Output
For each query of type 2, print the answer to it on a separate line.
