Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
Although Christmas has long since passed, Mr. and Mrs. J have a pile of N unopened gifts with values a1​,a2​,…,aN​.
They wish to distribute some (possibly all) of the gifts amongst their two children Alice and Bob, and give the rest away to charity. They must do so in such a manner that:

Alice and Bob get at least one gift each
each gift is given to at most one of the children, as they do not like to share
the sum of values of the gifts Alice gets is equal to the sum of values of gifts Bob gets

Given N and the values of all gifts, help Mr. and Mrs. J distribute the gifts or state that it is impossible to distribute them in a way that satisfies all conditions.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to distribute the gifts in the desired way, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain a single string with length N. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string should be:

'A' if the i-th gift is given to Alice
'B' if the i-th gift is given to Bob
'N' if the i-th gift is given to charity



If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
