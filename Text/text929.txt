Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.
Given an array of N numbers, a pair of numbers is called good if difference between the two numbers is strictly less than D.
Find out maximum possible sum of all good disjoint pairs that can be made from these numbers.
Sum of X pairs is the sum of all 2*X numbers in the pairs.
Input
First line contains T, the number of test cases to follow.
First line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers: N and D.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers.
Output

For each test case, output the answer in a separate line.
