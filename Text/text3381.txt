Problem
You are given a string S. Let the set of strings ST be the set of all distinct contiguous palindromic substrings of S. Each element of ST has a value associated with it which is initially 0. You need to process Q queries which are of the following two types:

1 L R P X: Add X to the values of all palindromes that are substrings of S[1...P] and are of the form T+S[L...R]+rev(T) where rev(T) denotes the reverse of T. Here T can be any string (possibly empty). It is guaranteed that S[L...R] is a palindrome.
2 L R: Print the value of S[L..R]. It is guaranteed that S[L...R] is a palindrome.

Input Format

The first line of input contains the string S.
The second line contains an integer Q - number of queries.
Next Q lines contain description of queries. Each line starts from integer type (1≤type≤2) - the type of the query.

If type=1, then rest of the line contains integers L,R,P,X.
If type=2, then rest of the line contains integers L,R.



Output Format
For each query of the second type, output the answer to it.
