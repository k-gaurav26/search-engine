Problem
Let's define Score of an array B of length M as ∑i=1M​∑j=iM​f(i,j), where f(i,j)=Bi​ ∣ Bi+1​ ∣ … ∣ Bj​ (Here ∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation)
You are given an array A, consisting of N distinct elements.
Find the sum of Score over all N! possible permutations of A.
Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated distinct integers A1​,A2​,…,An​ representing the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output the sum obtained modulo 998244353.
