Chef has an array A of length N. Chef constructs the range-array AL,R​ as follows:


First, Chef considers the subarray AL​,AL+1​,...,AR​.


Then Chef removes the integers that do not belong to the range [L,R] from the subarray to finally create the range-array AL,R​.


For example, consider the array A=[1,3,2,4], then the range-arrays are: A1,1​=[1],A1,2​=[1],A1,3​=[1,3,2],A1,4​=[1,3,2,4], A2,2​=[], A2,3​=[3,2], A2,4​=[3,2,4] and so on.
Chef is given a permutation A1​,A2​,…,AN​ of length N. A pair of integers (L,R)(1≤L≤R≤N) is called good if all the elements in the range array AL,R​ are sorted in increasing order. In case, a range array is an empty list, it is considered to be sorted. Chef tries to find the number of good pairs (L,R), but fails. Can you help him?
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integer A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of good pairs.
