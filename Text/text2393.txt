Chef has started learning to solve dynamic programming problems recently. He has practiced on a lot of problems already, so he wants to try his hands on the hardest problems in this domain.
Chef only likes the interesting part of solving dynamic programming problems — specifically, he just likes to divide a problem into beautiful subproblems which consist of solving recurrences; he finds actually solving these recurrences quite boring. Since you are Chef's assistant, your job is solving this boring part for Chef.
Let's define a recurrent sequence {dp(k)}k=1∞​ with parametres A, B and K as follows:

dp(1)=K
for n>1, dp(n)=A⋅dp(n−1)+B⋅i=1∑n−1​dp(i)⋅dp(n−i)

Chef would like you to find the sum i=L∑R​dp(i)2. Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7. He wants to do this for Q pairs of L and R.
Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers N, K, A and B.
The second line of the input contains Q.
The next Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For every query print a single line containing one integer — the sum i=L∑R​dp(i)2 modulo 109+7.
