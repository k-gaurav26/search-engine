Given an array A1​,A2​,...,AN​, count the number of subarrays of array A which are non-decreasing.
A subarray A[i,j], where 1≤i≤j≤N is a sequence of integers Ai​,Ai​+1,...,Aj​.
A subarray A[i,j] is non-decreasing if Ai​≤Ai​+1≤Ai​+2≤...≤Aj​. You have to count the total number of such subarrays.
Input


The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.


The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array.


The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​, A2​, ..., AN​ denoting the elements of the array.


Output
For each test case, output in a single line the required answer.
