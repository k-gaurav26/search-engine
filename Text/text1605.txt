Problem
Given two integers N and M, find how many permutations of 1, 2, ..., N (first N natural numbers) are there where the sum of every two adjacent numbers is at most M.
Input
First line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain two integers N and M.
Output
For each test case output a single one line containing number of such permutations modulo 1000000007.
