Problem
Given a positive integer N, find a possible arrangement of the integers from 0 to N -1 such that the binary representation of every number (except the first) differs at most at one bit from the binary representation of the number before it. Or tell that itâ€™s impossible to get such an arrangement.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For every testcase print N integers on a single line, the required sequence. If there are multiple possible answers, print any one. If no such sequence is possible, print -1.
