Problem
Chef has an integer N. He repeats the following operation until N becomes 1.

Chef chooses an integer X such that X>1 and X is a divisor of N and then divides N by X (the new value of N becomes N/X). If X is even, Chef gets A points otherwise he gets B points

Can you find the maximum points Chef can get if he performs the operations optimally?
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input containing three integers N,A,B.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum points Chef can get.
