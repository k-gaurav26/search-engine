Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.
Consider a string s. The following operation can be performed on it successively several (possibly zero) times.

Select any non empty suffix of s and append it to s

For example, if s=abcd, then s can become either abcdd, abcdcd, abcdbcd or abcdabcd after one operation. Successive operations are now performed on the new string.
You are given a string t, the resultant string after applying several (possibly zero) operations on some string. You must find any such string s of the shortest length from which t can be obtained after some sequence of operations. It can be proven that such a string always exists.
Input Format


The first line contains one number T, the number of test cases.


The only line of each test case contains the string t.


Output Format
For each test case print a string s of the shortest possible length which satisfies the requirements. If there are multiple such strings, you may print any.
