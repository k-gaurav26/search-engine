Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a sequence of integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
You should choose an arbitrary (possibly empty) subsequence of A and multiply each element of this subsequence by −1. The resulting sequence should satisfy the following condition: the sum of elements of any contiguous subsequence with length greater than 1 is strictly positive.
You should minimise the sum of elements of the resulting sequence. Find one such sequence with the minimum possible sum.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​. For each valid i, Bi​ must be equal to either Ai​ (the sign of this element did not change) or −Ai​ (the sign of this element changed).
If there is more than one answer, you may output any one.
