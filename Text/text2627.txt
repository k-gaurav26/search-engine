Problem

Given a binary represantation of number N. You are to find how many numbers from 0 to N have even number of ones in their binary represantation.
There is also an update operation, update (L,R), which means that all bits of N from Lth to Rth are flipped, i.e. ones to zeroes and vice versa. You have to also find the answer after each of these updates.

Input
The first line of input file contains binary represantation of number N. The second line contains number M - the number of update queries. Then M lines follow that describe each update query by two numbers - L and R. Note that the digits of N are numbered from left to right. That is, the leftmost(most significant) bit is numbered 1.
Output
Output the answer for initial value of N and also after each of the M updates modulo 109+7 in separate lines.
