Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.
You are given an array A with N integers. An array's score is defined as the bitwise AND of all its elements. You need to find the bitwise OR of the scores of all possible non-empty subarrays of A.
Furthermore, there are Q queries. Each query consists of two integers X and V. You need to change the value of the element at index X to V. After each query, you again need to find the bitwise OR of the scores of all possible non-empty subarrays.
See the example for more clarification.
Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q - the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,…,AN​.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers X and V - the position and the new value of the query, respectively.
Output:
For each test case print Q+1 lines. In the first line print the answer for the original array and in the next Q lines print the answer after every query.
