Problem
You are given a binary string A of length N. Rearrange the binary string to form binary strings S and T such that the length of the longest common substring between S and T is minimum.
Print both strings S and T.
Note that both S and T must be anagrams of A — see the examples below for more clarity.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the length of the binary string A.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string A of length N.

Output Format

For each test case, output two lines. The first line contains string S while the second line contains string T. Both strings S and T must be anagrams of string A and thus, have length N.
