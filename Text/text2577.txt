Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Chef has a tree (with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N) where each edge has some length.
The Chef length of a path is the median of the lengths of all edges along the path. More formally: if we put lengths of all edges from the path into an array and sort it, then the Chef length of this path is the median of this array (element in the middle of the sorted array, and if we have two elements in the middle of the array, then the median is the bigger one). For example, if the array equals {3, 7, 9}, then its median is 7, and if the array equals {1, 2, 3, 4}, then the median is 3.
Now, Chef wants to find minimum Chef length among simple paths having at least L and at most R edges. Please help him accomplish this task.
Input

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
The first line for a test case contains three space-separated integers - N, L, R - denoting the number of nodes in a tree, and the limits on number of edges in any chosen path.
Each of next N âˆ’ 1 lines contains three space-separated integers - a, b and c - describing an edge in the tree. This edge connects vertex a with vertex b and has length c.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the shortest Chef length amongst paths satisfying the given conditions. If there are no paths with at least L and at most R edges, output -1.
