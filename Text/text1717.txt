Problem
For a permutation P of the integers 1 to N, we define a new array AP​ of length N−2 as follows:

For 1≤i≤N−2, (AP​)i​ denotes the number of inversions in the subarray P[i:i+2], i.e, the number of inversions in the array [Pi​,Pi+1​,Pi+2​].

You are given an array A of length N, all of whose elements lie between 0 and 3. Does there exist a permutation P of length N+2 such that AP​=A?
Input Format

The first line of input will contain one integer T, the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers — the values of A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the answer — YES if a permutation that satisfies the given conditions exists, and NO otherwise.
The output is not case sensitive, so for example the strings YES, Yes, yES, etc. will all be treated as correct.
