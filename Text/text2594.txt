Problem Statement

As we know, Fibonacci Number is defined as 

Fn=n if n  ≤ 1 
Fn=Fn-1+Fn-2, otherwise

Now this problem is quite simple: you are given one  prime number  P and one non-negative integer C
You are expected to find the smallest non-negative integer  n, such that
Fn≡C(mod P)
The definition of "mod" could be found here:

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Only one line of each test case, which contains two integers C and P denoting the number described above.

 
Output

For each test case, output a single line containing one integer indicates the smallest n. If such n do not exist, output -1 instead
