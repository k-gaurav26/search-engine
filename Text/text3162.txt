Problem
Given an array of size N and two integers K and S, the special sum of a subarray is defined as follows:
(Sum of all elements of the subarray) * (K - p * S)
Where p = number of distinct prime factors of “product of all elements of the subarray”.
Find the maximum special sum by considering all non-empty subarrays of the given array.
Input

First line contains 3 integers N, K and S.
Second line contains N integers, the elements of the array.

Output
Output a single integer. The maximum special sum considering all non-empty subarrays of the array.
