Problem
Chef is playing a game on the non-negative x-axis. It takes him 1 second to reach from ith position to (i−1)th position or (i+1)th position. The chef never goes to the negative x-axis. Also, Chef doesn't stop at any moment of time.
The movement of chef can be described as follows.

At the start he is standing at x=0 at time 0.
In the first round, he moves towards x=1 and comes back to the x=0 position.
In the second round, he moves towards the x=2 and comes back again to x=0.
Generalizing, in the kth round, he moves from x=0 to x=k and then returns back to x=0 at the end of the round. This goes on as the game progresses.

For Example, the path of Chef for 3rd round is given below.
0−1−2−3−2−1−0
The overall path followed by Chef would look somewhat like this:
0−1−0−1−2−1−0−1−2−3−2−1−0−1−2−3−4−3−…
You are given two non-negative integers N and K. You have to tell the time at which Chef arrives at x=N for the Kth time.
Note - Chef can not skip a position while visiting the positions.
Input:

The first line contains T the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of two integers N and K.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer -- the time taken by the chef to arrive at x=N for the Kth time by modulo 1,000,000,007.
