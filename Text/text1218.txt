Chef has an array A consisting of N integers. He also has an intger K.
Chef wants you to find out number of different arrays he can obtain from array A by applying the following operation exactly K times.

Pick some element in the array and multiply it by -1



As answer could be quite large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, K as defined above.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of different arrays Chef can get modulo 109 + 7.
