Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is given a tree of N nodes.
Let M denote the number of simple paths with at least two nodes.
Notice that M = N * (N - 1) / 2.
There are (M * (M - 1) * (M - 2) / 6) unordered triples of such paths.
Your task is to count how many of them are nice.
A triple of paths (A, B, C) is nice if and only if either of the following conditions is satisfied:

The three paths are pairwise disjoint (no two of them share a node).
Each pair of paths intersect with each other.
In other words: paths A and B share at least one node, paths A and C share at least one node, and also paths B and C share at least one node.

Output the number of nice triples of paths modulo (109+7).

	Input

	The first line of the input contains an integer N.

Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers ai and bi denoting an edge between nodes ai and bi.

Output</h3>


	Output a single integer, denoting the number of nice triples of paths modulo (109+7).
