Chef has a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​; each element of this sequence is either 0 or 1. Appy gave him a string S with length Q describing a sequence of queries. There are two types of queries:

'!': right-shift the sequence A, i.e. replace A by another sequence B1​,B2​,…,BN​ satisfying Bi+1​=Ai​ for each valid i and B1​=AN​
'?': find the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of A with length ≤K such that each element of this subsequence is equal to 1

Answer all queries of the second type.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, Q and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains a string with length Q describing queries. Each character of this string is either '?', denoting a query of the second type, or '!', denoting a query of the first type.

Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer — the length of the longest required subsequence.
