Problem

Chef Ciel is going to organize a quiz game in her restaurant.
Ciel has N problems, and she will choose K problems for the quiz game.
Every participant has to answer all K problems.


Ciel thinks that if a participant solves all K problems correctly, the participant will get bored,
and if a participant solves less problems correctly, the participant will feel sad.
Therefore, Ciel decides to choose K problems maximizing the probability that participants will solve exactly K-1 problems correctly.


The N problems are numbered from 1 to N.
Ciel assumes, the problem i will be solved correctly with probability Pi% for each i, and these are statistically independent of each other.


Can you tell what problems are chosen by Ciel?

Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow.
The first line for each test case has 2 integers N and K.
The next line has N integers P1, P2, ..., PN.

Output

For each test case, print K distinct integers denoting the numbers of chosen problems.
If there are multiple sets of problems maximizing the probability, then anyone will do.
