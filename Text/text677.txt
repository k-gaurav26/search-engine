Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
There are K problems in a contest with N participants. All the problems don't necessarily have the same points assigned to them - you are given an array A of integers, where Ai​ denotes the points assigned to the ith problem. If a participant solves the ith problem, they will get Ai​ points added to their total score. Note that there are no partial points - they can get only 0 or Ai​ points on the ith problem. For each participant i, you are also given their final verdict in each problem in the form of a binary string Si​ - a 1 denotes that they solved that problem, and a 0 denotes that they did not.
Your job is to find the total score of each participant.
Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains 2 space separated integers, N and K, denoting the number of participants and the number of problems in the contest respectively.
The second line contains K space separated integers - A1​,A2​,…,AK​, where Ai​ denotes the points assigned to the ith  problem.
The ith of the next N lines contains a binary string Si​ of length K, where Sij​ represents the verdict of the jth problem for ith participant. Sij​=1 if they solved that problem, and Sij​=0 otherwise.

Output:
For each testcase, output N lines, with the ith line containing a single integer denoting the total score of the ith participant.
