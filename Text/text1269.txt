Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You have an array of integers A1, A2, ..., AN. The function F(P), where P is a subset of A, is defined as the XOR (represented by the symbol ⊕) of all the integers present in the subset. If P is empty, then F(P)=0.
Given an integer K, what is the maximum value of K ⊕ F(P), over all possible subsets P of A?
Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of N and K in one line, followed by the array A in the next line.
Output
For each test case, print the required answer in one line.
