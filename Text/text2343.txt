 There is an infinite grid given to you. Some of the cells in this infinite grid have gems in them. Each gem a parameter beauty associated with it which is given by a positive integer.
You will be given an integer L. You have to find maximum sum of beauties inside any square sub-grid with its side length being less than or equal to L. Let S be that number, i.e. the maximum sum of beauties for some sub-grid with side length no greater than L. You also have to find minimum side length such that there exists some sqaure sub-grid with that given side length with sum of beauties of gems inside it being equal to S.
Input
First line of the input contains two space separated N and L, denoting the number of gems and the maximum allowed size of the sub-grid, respectively.
Each of the next N lines contains three space separated integers - 
xi, yi and ci denoting the x-coordinate, y-coordinate and the value of the ith gem respectively. 
Output
Output a single line containing two space separated integers: the maximum value of the sum of beauties of gem in some square sub-grid of the length not greater than L and the minimum side length of the square-grid which contains that much sum of beauties of gems inside it, respectively.
