Problem
f is a function such that f(x) equals the number of ways in which x can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers. For example f(10)=2, as 10 can be expressed as sum of two primes in two ways: 3+7=5+5=10. More formally, f(x) is the number of pairs (a,b) such that 0≤a≤b<x and a and b are prime and a+b=x.
Given an integer N, find the number of pairs (a,b) such that 0≤a≤b<N and f(a)+f(b)=f(N).
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, a integer N.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the required answer.
