Chef has two numbers N and M. Help Chef to find number of integer N-tuples (A1​,A2​,…,AN​) such that 0≤A1​,A2​,…,AN​≤2M−1 and A1​&A2​&…&AN​=0, where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.
Since the number of tuples can be large, output it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and M.

Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem modulo 109+7.
