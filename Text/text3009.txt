Watson has infinite supply of K different type of objects denoted by numbers 1 to K. He makes an array A of N objects, A1, A2, ..., AN using these objects.
Now, he'll update this array Q times. In ith update, he'll replace an existing object in array with a new object of different type from 1 to K i.e. Axi = yi.


After each update, he wants Sherlock to report the smallest size of a contiguous subarray which contains all types of objects i.e. smallest value of R - L + 1 such that number of distinct values in AL, AL + 1, ..., Ar is K. If no such subarray exists, Sherlock should output -1.

Input

First line contains N, K and Q denoting number of array elements, number of different types of objects and number of updates. Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the initial array A. ith of the next Q lines contains integers xi and yi, denoting the update parameters of the ith update.

Output

After each update, output an integer in one line denoting the smallest contiguous subarray size consisting of all types of objects. If no such subarray exists, output -1.
