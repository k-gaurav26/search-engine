Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Chef studies very well in his University. There is only one professor who doesn't want to give him the highest grade, A. Chef has had a long argument with him, and eventually they agreed, that if Chef solves an algorithmic problem, he gets the highest grade. After looking at the problem, he realized he can't solve it. Once again, he approached Codechef admins for help, and once again we decided to put it off and pass on the task to you. Please, help him (and us)!
Problem description
You are given an array A of integers and an integer K. Your goal is  to divide the array into K consecutive disjoint non-empty groups, so that any array element belongs to exactly one group.
Each group can be specified by two integers L and R (L â‰¤ R) with the meaning that the group contains all the elements from the Lth to the Rth one (both inclusive) in the given array. The cost of such a group equals to the value of bitwise OR of all elements in the group. 
The cost of array for some particular group division equals to the sum of costs for all the groups. You have to find the maximal achievable cost of the given array.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K denoting the number of elements in the array and number of groups, respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the given array. 
Output
For each test case, output a single line, containing the maximal achievable cost of the array.
