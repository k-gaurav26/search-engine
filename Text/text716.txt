Chef has two positive integers X and Y. Now Chef wants to perform some number of operations (possibly zero) on them. In each operation, Chef can choose either X or Y and increment it by 1. Find the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that there is a positive integer strictly greater than 1 which divides both X and Y (In other words, the greatest common divisor of X and Y should be greater than 1).
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and Y.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform.
