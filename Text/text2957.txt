You are given an integer K and a tree of size N, rooted at node 1. In one operation, you can either select a node of the tree and color its entire subtree or create a new (uncolored) copy of the given tree. Find the minimum number of operations required so that the total number of colored nodes among all trees is exactly K.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains two integers N and K, the size of the given tree and the number of nodes to be colored, respectively.
The next line contains N−1 integers p2​,…,pn​, where pi​ is the parent of node i.

Output
For each testcase, output a single integer: the minimum number of operations required to color exactly K total nodes.
