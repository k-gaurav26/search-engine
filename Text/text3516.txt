Chef is playing a game that lasts M seconds. She has a matrix A[M][N][N] which contains a single integer in each of the M * N * N cells. For each k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ M, on the k-th second, she chooses some pair (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. This will fetch her A[k][i][j] points. She also has a 2-D Cartesian plane which is empty initially. Then for each second k, where k > 1, she will draw a line segment in the plane which joins the coordinates (i, j) and the coordinates chosen in the previous second. She can only select the pair (i, j) if this segment doesn't intersect with any already drawn segment (the touching of the newly drawn segment at the previous second segment point is allowed). So, the segments shouldn't intersect with each other at any point (except two consecutive segments touching at a single point). She is also not allowed to choose a pair (i, j) more than once. If Chef is not able to select a pair, or doesn't wish to play the game any longer, she can exit the game at any point. The aim is to maximize the sum of the points scored.
Can you please play the game on behalf of Chef?
Input
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, M.
Next, you will provided matrix A[k] for each k from 1 to M.
The k-th matrix is given by N lines each containing N space separated integers.
Output
You should output at least 1 and at most M lines with two integers in each, denoting the r (for row index) and c (for column index) of the cells selected (1-based indexing) or "-1 -1" in order to exit the game.
