Given an integer N, you can apply a operation on N multiple times(possibly 0).
Operation is defined as follows:

Choose a positive integer K such that K has exactly 4 divisors and K is a divisor of N.
Change N to N/K.

Find the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number N.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integers N.

Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number.
