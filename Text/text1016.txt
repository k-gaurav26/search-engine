Problem
Read problem statements in Russian and Mandarin Chinese.
You are given two integers A,B. You have to choose an integer X in the range [minimum(A,B), maximum(A,B)] such that:
⌈2B−X​⌉+⌈2X−A​⌉ is maximum.
What is the maximum sum you can obtain if you choose X optimally?
Note: ⌈x⌉ : Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x (i.e  rounds up to the nearest integer). For example, ⌈1.4⌉=2, ⌈5⌉=5, ⌈−1.5⌉=−1, ⌈−3⌉=−3 , ⌈0⌉=0.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers A,B.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the maximum sum of ⌈2B−X​⌉+⌈2X−A​⌉.
