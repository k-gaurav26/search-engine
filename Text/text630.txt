There's an array A consisting of N non-zero integers A1..N. A subarray of A is called alternating if any two adjacent elements in it have different signs (i.e. one of them should be negative and the other should be positive).

For each x from 1 to N, compute the length of the longest alternating subarray that starts at x - that is, a subarray Ax..y for the maximum possible y â‰¥ x. The length of such a subarray is y-x+1.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains N.
The following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N.

Output
For each test case, output one line with N space-separated integers - the lengths of the longest alternating subarray starting at x, for each x from 1 to N.
