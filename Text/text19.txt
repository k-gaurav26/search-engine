Problem
There is a binary string S. Alice and Bob are playing a game on it.
Each turn, the following happens:

Alice selects a 01 subsequence in S and removes it from S. (a 01 subsequence is a length 2 subsequence whose first character is 0 and second character is 1)
Bob selects a 01 subsequence in S and removes it from S.
After both players have moved, the turn is called completed and Alice scores 1 point. Then, the next turn begins.

If either player is unable to move (there isn't any 01 subsequence left in S), that turn ends immediately and the game ends.
Alice tries to maximize her points, while Bob tries to minimize Alice's points. Find how many points Alice would score if both players play optimally.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains a binary string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single integer — Alice's score when both players play optimally.
