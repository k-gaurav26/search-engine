Problem
Long long ago, there is a magic board. The magic board has N*N cells: N rows and N columns. Every cell contains one integer, which is 0 initially. Let the rows and the columns be numbered from 1 to N.
There are 2 types of operations can be applied to the magic board:
RowSet i x: it means that all integers in the cells on row i have been changed to x after this operation.
ColSet i x: it means that all integers in the cells on column i have been changed to x after this operation.
And your girlfriend sometimes has an interest in the total number of the integers 0s on some row or column.
RowQuery i: it means that you should answer the total number of 0s on row i.
ColQuery i: it means that you should answer the total number of 0s on column i.
Input
The first line of input contains 2 space-separated integers N and Q. They indicate the size of the magic board, and the total number of operations and queries from the girlfriend.
Then each of the next Q lines contains an operation or a query by the format mentioned above.
Output
For each query, output the answer of the query.
