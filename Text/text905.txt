Problem
Alice has an array A of length N. She is interested in finding the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and Ai​⊕Aj​<Ai​&amp;Aj​.
⊕ represents the Bitwise XOR operator.
&amp; represents the Bitwise AND operator.
Input Format

The first line of input will contain an integer T — number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the length of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and Ai​⊕Aj​<Ai​&amp;Aj​.
