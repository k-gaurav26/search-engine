Problem
You love array, don't you?
You are given two integer N and M, along with an array B of length N containing pairwise distinct integers. You have to find the number of array A of length N satisfying the follow conditions:

1≤Ai​≤M.
Ai​=Aj​ for all 1≤i<j≤N.
Ai​=Bi​ for all 1≤i≤N.

Since the answer can be very large, output it under modulo 109+7.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line of the input contains N separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​ - the array B.

Output Format
Output on a single line the number of satisfactory array modulo 109+7.
