Problem
A sequence of N integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to N exactly once.
For a permutation P of length N (where N is an even integer), we define the function F(P) as:
F(P)= (P1​⊕P2​)+(P3​⊕P4​)+…+(Pn−1​⊕Pn​). Here, ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
For Example: If P=[1,3,4,2] then F(P)=(1⊕3)+(4⊕2)=8.
Given an even integer N, construct a permutation P of length N, such that F(P) is minimum.
If multiple such permutations exist, output any one of them.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one even integer N - the length of the permutation to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, print any permutation P of length N such that F(P) is minimum.
