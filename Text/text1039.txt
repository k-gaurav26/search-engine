Problem
You are given a set of N strings S0, S1, â€¦, SN-1. These strings consist of only lower case characters a..z and have the same length L. 
A string H is said to be K-important if there are at least K strings in the given set of N strings appearing at K different positions in H. These K strings need not to be distinct.
Your task is to find the shortest K-important string. If there are more than one possible solution, your program can output any of them.
Input
The first line contains a number t (about 10) which is the number of test cases.
Each test case has the following form.
The first line contains three integers N, L and K. The next N lines contain the strings in the given set.
Each test case's input is separated by a blank line.
