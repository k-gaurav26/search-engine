Problem
Problem description.
 Chef became the problem writer of ACM/ICPC regional contest this year. One week before the contest, Chef came up with an interesting idea, and wrote the following problem :Â 
 Given N integers A1, A2, ..., An, print YES (or NO) if there exists (or not) 3 numbers that form an arithmetic sequence. All integers are between 0 and 99999 (inclusive).
 As Chef expected, during the contest, most teams cannot figure out an efficient algorithm to solve it. But in the last minute of the contest, judges get one 10-lines submission, which is judged as correct. The short solution works as follows, if N > 2000, output YES, otherwise brute-force it. 
 Chef felt extremely disappointed, and he/she believed that the solution is definitely wrong. Chef is now interested in how to challenge the submission. 
 Chef needs your help. Chef would like you to find a set of integers, such that no 3 integers form an arithmetic sequence. To make the task more challenging, you are given a list of M integers B1, B2, ..., BM. You can only use integers from this list. The set does not require maximality, but larger sets will score more points.
Input
 The first line of the input contains an integer M   denoting the length of the list. The second line contains M space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BM denoting the list.
Output
First output the integer N on the first line. Then output N integers A1, A2, ..., AN on the second line.
