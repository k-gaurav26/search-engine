Problem
You are given an array A=[A1​,A2​,…,AN​] containing distinct positive integers.
Let B be a permutation of A. Define the value of B to be
∑i=1N​(Bi​modBi+1​)
where BN+1​ is treated to be B1​.
Find the maximum value across all permutations of A.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the size of A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers — the elements of A.

Output Format

For each test case, output a new line containing the answer — the maximum possible value across all permutations of A.
