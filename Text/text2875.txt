Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given N integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​. Let's define functions f and g:
f(x,k)=(x+a1​)k+(x+a2​)k+⋯+(x+aN​)k
g(t,k)=f(0,k)+f(1,k)+⋯+f(t,k)
You are also given integers T and K. Calculate g(T,i) modulo 109+7 for each i between 0 and K inclusive.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, K and T.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.

Output
Print a single line containing K+1 space-separated integers — the values of g(T,0),g(T,1),…,g(T,K) modulo 109+7.
