Problem

Chef Ciel defined a sequence S as follows:
S[1] = A
S[2] = B
S[i] = (X*S[i-1] + Y*S[i-2] + Z) mod P, for i >= 3


Ciel considers C is a lucky number, and the i-th day is a lucky day if and only if S[i] = C.
Ciel's restaurant may have special events in a lucky day.


By the way, your work is calculating the numbers of lucky days in intervals.
That is, for each Q intervals [L[i], R[i]], 
you should calculate the number of the integers k which satisfy L[i] <= k <= R[i] and S[k] = C.

Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow.
The first line for each test case has 8 integers A, B, X, Y, Z, P, C and Q.
The next Q lines have 2 integers L[i] and R[i].

Output

For each interval, print the number of lucky days in the interval.
