Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Consider a positive even integer L and N distinct integers a1, a2, ..., aN such that | ai - aj | ≤ L for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. Now, we define a far graph induced by L and a1..N as a graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) satisfying the following condition: for each pair of vertices u and v, there is an undirected edge between u and v if and only if | au - av | ≥ L/2.
Given a simple graph G, you should find integers L and a1, a2, ..., aN such that G is a far graph induced by them, or determine that no such integers exist.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of testcases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges in the input graph G respectively.
Each of the following M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between vertices u and v.

Output
For each test case:
If it's impossible to choose valid numbers L and a1, a2, ..., aN such that the graph G is a far graph, print a single line containing a single string "No" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first line should contain a single string "Yes" (without quotes).
The second line should contain N+1 space-separated integers L, a1, a2, ..., aN such that G is a far graph and the following constraints hold:

1 ≤ L ≤ 2 · 109
L is even
all ai are distinct
-109 ≤ ai ≤ 109 for each valid i

It's guaranteed that if G is an induced far graph, then it's possible to choose L, a1, a2, ..., aN satisfying these constraints.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one.
