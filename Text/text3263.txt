Problem
Nayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random arrays as birthday presents, but this time she received an array as a present for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with this array, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her this problem.
You are given an array A=[A1​,A2​,…,AN​] containing N distinct integers. Count the number of ways to form (unordered) sets of disjoint increasing subsequences of A.
Formally, count the number of sets S={S1​,S2​,…,Sk​} such that:

Each Si​ is an increasing subsequence of A.
If i=j, Si​ and Sj​ are disjoint, i.e, i=j⟹Si​∩Sj​=∅

Note that it is not necessary that the sequences S1​,S2​,…,Sk​ form a partition of A - in other words, some elements of A may not be in any chosen subsequence.
Two sets are considered equal if they contain the same subsequences. For example, the sets {[1,2],[3]} and {[3],[1,2]} are considered to be the same and should only be counted once.
Note that the final answer can be rather large, so compute its remainder after dividing it by 109+7.
Please refer to the sample for a few examples.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the size of A.
The second line contains N distinct space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ - the elements of A.

Output Format
For each test, print one line containing a single integer, the answer to the problem modulo (109+7).
