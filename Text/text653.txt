Problem
Chef recently printed directions from his home to a hot new restaurant across the town, but forgot to print the directions to get back home. Help Chef to transform the directions to get home from the restaurant.
A set of directions consists of several instructions. The first instruction is of the form "Begin on XXX", indicating the street that the route begins on. Each subsequent instruction is of the form "Left on XXX" or "Right on XXX", indicating a turn onto the specified road.
When reversing directions, all left turns become right turns and vice versa, and the order of roads and turns is reversed. See the sample input for examples.
Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases that follow. Each test case begins with an integer N, the number of instructions in the route. N lines follow, each with exactly one instruction in the format described above.
Output
For each test case, print the directions of the reversed route, one instruction per line. Print a blank line after each test case.
