In every contest there should be an easy problem about matrices. December Cook-Off is not an exception.
Given a matrix A which consists of n rows and m columns, and contains integer numbers.
Consider every possible vector v of m elements, such that every 1 ≤ vi ≤ n.
Let value of the vector be product of all Avi, i  (1 ≤ i ≤ m). You are to count the sum of values over all possible vectors v.

 Input details
The first line contains two integers n and m — dimensions of the matrix. Then n lines of m integers follow. The jth element of ith line contains Ai, j.

 Output details

Output single integer — the answer for the problem modulo 107 + 7, i.e the smallest non-negative integer number r that answer - r is divisible by 107 + 7.
