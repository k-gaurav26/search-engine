Problem
Chef's college is starting next week. There are S subjects in total, and he needs to choose K of them to attend each day, to fulfill the required number of credits to pass the semester. There are N+1 buildings. His hostel is in building number 0. Subject i is taught in building Ai​. After each subject, there is a break, during which he goes back to his hostel. There are M bidirectional paths of length 1 which connects building u to building v. Find the minimum possible total distance Chef needs to travel each day if he chooses his subjects wisely.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contain M+2 lines of input.
First line will contain 4 space separated integers N, M, S, K, number of buildings other than hostel building, number of edges, total number of subjects taught, number of subjects required to pass the semester.
Next M lines have 2 space separated integers u, v representing the path connecting buildings u and v.
Next line has S space separated integers A1​,A2​,…AS​ representing the building in which ith subject is taught.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.
