You are given a weighted graph with N nodes and M edges. Some of the nodes are marked as special nodes. Your task is to find the shortest pairwise distance between any two different special nodes.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, M and K denoting the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the number of special nodes.
The next line contains K space-separated distinct integers A1​, A2​, …, AK​, denoting the special nodes.
The next M lines each contain three space-separated integers - X, Y, Z, denoting an edge connecting the nodes X and Y, with weight Z.

Output
Output the shortest pairwise distance between any two different special nodes.
