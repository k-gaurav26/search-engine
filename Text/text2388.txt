Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
The String street is known as the busiest street in Codeland.
Tourists from all over the world want to visit the street once they are in Codeland.
The Chef owns N souvenir stores across the street (numbered from 1 to N). 
At the beginning there is no souvenir in any store, the Chef has some plans to add some new items.
Each the Chef's plan is represented by 4 numbers: u v a b which mean an items with price b 
is added to the store u, an items with price a + b is added to the store u + 1 and so on. 
More formally, an item with price a * i + b is added to the store u + i for all (0 ≤ i ≤ v - u).
In additional to the cost of the item itself, the tourist must pay some conservation fees as well.
The Codeland regularly defines the new conservation fee. Each fee is represented by 4 numbers: u v a b which means
the tourist buying any item in the store u + i will be charged a fee of i * a + b for all (0 ≤ i ≤ v - u).
In the case that several conservation fees have effect on the same store, the customer needs to pay all of those fees.
At some point of time, a tourist at store i asks you what is the largest amount of money they have to spend for 
a souvenir at that store (the amount of money includes the price of one of the souvenirs and all the conservation fees for that store).
