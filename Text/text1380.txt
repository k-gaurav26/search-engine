Problem
It is well-known that the elephants are afraid of mouses. The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is not an exception.
The Little Elephant is on a board A of n rows and m columns (0-based numeration). At the beginning he is in cell with coordinates (0; 0) and he wants to go to cell with coordinates (n-1; m-1). From cell (x; y) Little Elephant can go either to (x+1; y) or (x; y+1).
Each cell of the board contains either 1 or 0. If A[i][j] = 1, then there is a single mouse in cell (i; j). Mouse at cell (i; j) scared Little Elephants if and only if during the path there was at least one such cell (x; y) (which belongs to that path) and |i-x| + |j-y| <= 1.
Little Elephant wants to find some correct path from (0; 0) to (n-1; m-1) such that the number of mouses that have scared the Little Elephant is minimal possible. Print that number.
Input
First line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contain pair of integers n and m - the size of the board. Next n lines contain n strings, each of size m and consisted of digits 0 and 1.
Output
In T lines print T integer - the answers for the corresponding test.
