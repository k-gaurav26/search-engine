Problem
Chef is given two integers N,S.
Consider an array A of size N such that A[i]=i for every 1≤i≤N.
You are required to find any position x(1≤x≤N) such that :
(A[1]+A[2]+...A[x−1])+(A[x+1]+A[x+2]+...A[N])=S
If there are multiple such positions x, print any such position. If there is no such position, print −1.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,S.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the required position or −1 in case there is no such position.
