Chef is stuck at the following problem. Help him solve it!
Chef has a sequence of integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. He should find the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and the bitwise XOR of Ai​ and Aj​ can be written as a sum of two (not necessarily different) prime numbers with the same parity (both odd or both even).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-seprated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid pairs.
