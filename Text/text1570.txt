Professor GukiZ decided to distribute all of his candies to his N students (numbered 1 through N). Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the i-th student by pi​. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence p:

The numbers of candies given to each of the first K students (p1​,p2​,…,pK​) are known exactly.
All elements of the sequence p are distinct.
The difference between the maximum and minimum element of the sequence p does not exceed x.
The professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. S=p1​+p2​+p3​+…+pN​ is maximum possible.

Normally, professors never lie, so the information provided by GukiZ is valid and there is at least one sequence that satisfies all conditions. GukiZ would like to know the total number of candies S he had at the beginning. Can you help him find this number?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and x.
The second line contains K space-separated integers p1​,p2​,…,pK​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of candies GukiZ had.
