Arya and Aryan live in a country called Nadaca. Nadaca consists of N cities numbered 1 through N, which are connected by some bidirectional roads. Each road has a positive (not necessarily integer) length. Arya lives in city 1 and Aryan lives in city N.
Arya claims that for each city v, the shortest path from city 1 to city v has length av​. Aryan does not disagree, but claims that for each city v, the shortest path from city N to city v has length bv​. You are the wisest person they know, so they asked you to tell them if it is possible for their claims to be true, i.e. if a road network which fully satisfies their claims exists. Help them!

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.
The third line contains N space-separated integers b1​,b2​,…,bN​.
