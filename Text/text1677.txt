Problem

Upon his first meeting with Laura, Professor X has got a problem for her. Although her exceptional skills are already visible, the professor wants to test her intellectual skills.


So, Professor X gives Laura an array A consisting of N natural numbers. The task for Laura is to distribute these N numbers into some groups such that for any 2 numbers of different groups, the Greatest Common Divisor of both numbers must be 1. Laura has to maximise the number of such groups possible and output the count of groups.
Can you help Laura with this problem ?
