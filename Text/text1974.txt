You are given a sequence of integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. For an integer K, let's define a K-compressed sequence B1​,B2​,…,BN​ as follows:

for each valid i, Bi​ is a positive integer
for each valid i, if there are exactly X numbers smaller than or equal to Ai​ in the subsequence Amax(1,i−K)​,…,Amin(N,i+K)​, then there must be exactly X numbers smaller than or equal to Bi​ in the subsequence Bmax(1,i−K)​,…,Bmin(N,i+K)​
B1​+B2​+⋯+BN​ is minimum possible

You may notice that for K=N−1 or K=N, this becomes the well-known technique of coordinate compression.
For example, consider the sequence A=[4,2,8,1,4,3,8,1]. If we choose K=1, then the K-compressed sequence will be B=[2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1]. The sum of its elements is 12, which is the minimum.
For a given integer S, find the number of values of K (0≤K≤N) such that the sum of elements of the K-compressed sequence does not exceed S.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and S.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of values of K such that the sum of the compressed sequence is ≤S.
