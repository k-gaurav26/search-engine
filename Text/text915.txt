Problem
A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.
For example, P→a⋅Q+b⋅R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 1 unit of P is converted into a unit of Q and b unit of R after completion of the reaction.
You are given N compounds numbered from 1 to N. The initial amount of the ith compound is Qi​.
You are also given M equations. Every equation is of the form:
C0​→W1​⋅C1​+W2​⋅C2​+…+WX​⋅CX​.
Here:

C0​ represents the compound which will decompose into X compounds on heating.
Ci​ (1≤i≤X) represents the compounds into which C0​ is decomposed.
Wi​ (1≤i≤X) represents the number of units of Ci​ produced due to the decomposition of C0​.
Ci​>Ci−1​ for all (1≤i≤X).

Note that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.
Find the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 109+7.
Input Format

First line will contain two space separated integers N and M - the number of compounds and the number of equations.
Second line will contain N space separated integers Q1​,Q2​,...,QN​ - the initial amounts of each compound.
The next 2⋅M lines contain the details of the M equations.  Each equation is represented using 2 lines.
First line of the ith equation contains two space separated integers Ci,0​, Xi​ - the decomposing compound and the number of compounds in which it decomposes.
Second line of the ith equation contains 2⋅Xi​ space separated integers Wi,1​,Ci,1​,Wi,2​,Ci,2​,…,Wi,Xi​​,Ci,Xi​​ - the number of units and the types of compounds into which Ci,0​ decomposes.

Output Format
Print N lines. The ith line contains a single integer denoting the final amount of the ith compound after prolonged heating modulo 109+7.
