Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese.
 
In a rooted tree, the lowest common ancestor (or LCA for short) of two vertices u and v is defined as the lowest vertex that is ancestor of both that two vertices.
Given a tree of N vertices, you need to answer the question of the form "r u v" which means if the root of the tree is at r then what is LCA of u and v.
 
Input
The first line contains a single integer N. Each line in the next N - 1 lines contains a pair of integer u and v representing a edge between this two vertices.
The next line contains a single integer Q which is the number of the queries. Each line in the next Q lines contains three integers  r, u, v representing a query.
 
Output
For each query, write out the answer on a single line.
