Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Vidhi went to a magic show last week where she was astounded by a magic trick performed by the great Mandwarf, the brown. His trick was as follows :

    Ask a volunteer from the audience to write down a list L of N integers. 
    
<li>
Ask another volunteer from the audience to provide three integers <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>
</li>

<li>
Ask another volunteer from the audience to provide <b>N</b> length string called <b>S</b> where each letter is either 'R', 'A' or 'M'
</li>

<li>
Close his eyes for a split second and give the output of The Ancient Algorithm on this input. 
</li>


We all know that The Ancient Algorithm is as follows :
for i from 1 to N do 

    if ith letter of S is 'R'
        reverse L[i...N]
    else if ith letter of S is 'A'
        add A to all numbers of L[i..N].
    else if ith letter of S is 'M'
        multiply B to all numbers of L[i..N].

    for all number in L[i..N], module them by C.

    announce L[i] out loud

end


Vidhi's boyfriend got jealous when he saw her getting impressed by Mandwarf, the brown's wisdom. He wants to learn the trick to gain her undivided admiration. How about you help him?
