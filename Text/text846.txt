Problem
Chef has a binary string S of length N. Chef can perform the following operation on S any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose a number X (1≤X≤N) that hasn't been chosen in any previous operation and flip any substring of S having length X (i.e. change all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s in any substring of S having length X).

Chef wants to transform S into a non-decreasing string using any sequence of operations. Can you help Chef find such a sequence of operations?
If there are multiple answers, print any.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the binary string S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N containing 0s and 1s only.

Output Format
For each test case,

Output in the first line K - the number of operations applied.
In each of the following K lines, output two integers i and X - the starting index of the substring selected and the length of the substring. (Note that X selected should not be used in any of the previous operations)
