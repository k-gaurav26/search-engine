Problem
 Chef loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
 Let F(X) equals to the number of lucky digits in decimal representation of X. Chef wants to know the number of such integers X, that L ≤ X ≤ R and F(X) is a lucky number. Help him and calculate that number modulo 109+7.
Input
First line contains one integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains two space separated positive integers L and R.
Output
For each of the T test cases print one integer, the number of such X, that L ≤ X ≤ R and F(X) is a lucky number, modulo 1000000007.
