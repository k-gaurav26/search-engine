Problem
Find the length of the longest contiguous segment in an array, in which if a given element K is inserted, K becomes the second largest element of that subarray.
Input:

The first line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.
The next line contains N space-separated integers Ai denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Print a single line corresponding to each test case â€” the length of the largest segment.
