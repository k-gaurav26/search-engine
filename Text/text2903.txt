	There is a directed acyclic graph with N vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.

	For every 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1, there is an edge from vertex i to vertex i+1, which has weight ai.

	For every 1 ≤ i ≤ N-2, there is an edge from vertex i to vertex i+2, which has weight bi.

	For every 1 ≤ i ≤ N-3, there is an edge from vertex i to vertex i+3, which has weight ci.

	There are no other edges.

	For each pair of vertices s, t where s < t, let d(s, t) denote the length of the shortest path from s to t. Your task is to compute the sum of d(s, t) for every 1 ≤ s < t ≤ N.

	Input

	First line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. T test cases follow.

	For each test case:

	The first line contains an integer N.

	The second line contains N - 1 integers a1, a2, ..., aN-1.

	The third line contains N - 2 integers b1, b2, ..., bN-2.


		The fourth line contains N - 3 integers c1, c2, ..., cN-3.


	Output

	For each test case, output a single line containing an integer, denoting the answer. It can be proved that the answer fits in the signed 64-bit type.
