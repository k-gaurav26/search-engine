Chefina gave Chef a sequence F1​,F2​,…,FN​ as a birthday present. She constructed it from a sequence of positive integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ in the following way: for each valid i, Fi​=∑j=1i​(−1)(j+1)⋅Aj​.
Unfortunately, Chef was playing with the sequence F and shuffled it. Now, he has a sequence denoted by B, but he does not remember F. The only things he knows are that F is a permutation of B and among all such permutations which Chefina could have constructed, her sequence F was the lexicographically smallest.
Chef does not want to disappoint Chefina, but he is too busy in the kitchen, so he asked you to help him recover F. Find the sequence F he got from Chefina or determine that he made another mistake and a sequence that satisfies the given conditions does not exist.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no solution, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes).
The second line should contain N space-separated integers F1​,F2​,…,FN​.
