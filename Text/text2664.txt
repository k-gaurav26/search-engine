Problem
Let P be a polynomial in n variables given by:
P(x1​,x2​,…,xn​)=(k+x1​+x2​+⋯+xn​)m
Here n, k and m are positive integers. Find the sum of all coefficients of the terms of the polynomial which have even powers in each of the n variables and output it modulo 109+7.
Note that the constant term's coefficient is also included in the sum. Please see the sample IO and Explanation for details.
Input:

First line will contain the number of testcases T
Each testcase will consist of single line with 3 positive integers n, k and m in that order

Output:
Output a single line containing the required sum modulo 1000000007 for each testcase.
