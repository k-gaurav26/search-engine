As New Year is approaching, Salik is studying functions in order to sharpen his math skills. Instead of regular functions, he is studying a strange function F which operates on non-negative integers. The value of F(A) is obtained by the following process:

Compute the sum of digits of A; let's denote this sum by S.
If S is a single-digit integer, then F(A) = S.
Otherwise, F(A) = F(S).

It's guaranteed that this process correctly defines the function F.

Since this problem was pretty straightforward, he invented a new problem: Given two integers A and N, compute F(AN). Can you help him solve this task?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the value of F(AN).
