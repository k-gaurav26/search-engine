Chef calls a sequence of integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ good if it satisfies the following conditions:

Ai​⊕Ai+1​>0 for all valid i
Ai−1​⊕Ai​⊕Ai+1​=Ai​ for all valid i

In particular, any sequence with length 1 is good and any sequence of length 2 which satisfies the first condition is good.
Here, ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Chef gives you a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. You may perform the following operation on the sequence any number of times (possibly 0): choose 3 pairwise distinct valid indices a, b and c and change Ac​ to Aa​⊕Ab​. Note that this means the operation can only be performed if N≥3.
Chef is asking you to make the sequence good using at most 3⋅N operations or report that it is impossible. Note that you do not have to minimise the number of performed operations.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to change the given sequence into a good sequence using at most 3⋅N operations, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer M (0≤M≤3⋅N) ― the number of operations you want to perform.
Then, print M lines describing these operations in the order in which you want to perform them. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines should contain three space-separated integers ai​, bi​ and ci​ (pairwise distinct; 1≤ai​,bi​,ci​≤N) ― the indices on which the i-th operation is performed.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
