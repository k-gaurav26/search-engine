Consider the following function, where + denotes string concatenation.
function BinaryConcatenation(integer X, integer Y):
        string binX = binary representation of X without leading zeroes
        string binY = binary representation of Y without leading zeroes

        string binXplusY = binX + binY
        string binYplusX = binY + binX

        integer XplusY = Convert binary representation binXplusY to integer
        integer YplusX = Convert binary representation binYplusX to integer
        return XplusY - YplusX

You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​, Find the maximum value of BinaryConcatenation(Ai​, Aj​) over all valid i and j.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum of BinaryConcatenation.
