Problem
Read problem statements in Russian and Mandarin Chinese.
Value of an array A of length L is defined as the sum of (Ai​⊕i) for all 0≤i<L, where ⊕ denotes bitwise xor operation. Note that array indices start from zero.
You are given an integer N and an array A consisting of 2N integers where Ai​=i for all 0≤i<2N.
Example :

For N=1, you have an array A of length 21=2 and A=[0,1].
For N=2, you have an array A of length 22=4 and A=[0,1,2,3].

You can do at most K operations on this array. In one operation, you can choose two indices i and j (0≤i,j<2N) and swap Ai​ and Aj​ (i.e. Ai​ becomes Aj​ and vice versa).
What is the maximum value of array A you can obtain after at most K operations?
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers N,K.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum value of array after doing at most K operations.
