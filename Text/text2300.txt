You are given K permutations of integers 1 through N. For each i (1≤i≤K), the i-th permutation is denoted by Ai,1​,Ai,2​,…,Ai,N​.
Construct a directed acyclic graph with N nodes (numbered 1 through N) such that:

Each of the given permutations is a valid topological sort of the graph. Formally, for each valid k and each i,j (1≤i<j≤N), there is no edge from the node Ak,j​ to the node Ak,i​.
The outdegree of each node is at most 1.
The number of nodes with indegree 0 is the smallest possible.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
K lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤K), the i-th of these lines contains N space-separated integers Ai,1​,Ai,2​,…,Ai,N​.

Output
For each test case, print two lines.

The first of these lines should contain one integer ― the minimum number of nodes with indegree 0.
The second line should contain N space-separated integers v1​,v2​,…,vN​ describing your graph in the following way: for each valid i, if vi​=0, there is no outgoing edge from the i-th node; otherwise, there is an edge from the i-th node to the vi​-th node.
