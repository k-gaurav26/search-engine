Problem
Read problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.
A tree is an undirected graph in which each pair of vertices is connected to each other by exactly one path. Weasel has a tree with N nodes. The indexing of the nodes is 0-based and the tree is rooted at node 0. Every node i has an initial value X0i.
Every day d > 0, he performs the following operations, starting from the root:

Weasel computes Xdu as the bitwise-xor sum of all the values Xd − 1v for a node v in u's subtree.
He recursively proceeds to perform the operation for every child of u.


For Q values of Δ, Weasel wants to compute XΔ0.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers N and Q.
Each of the following N − 1 lines contains two integers, u and v, an edge in the tree.
On the following line there are N integers, representing the X0 array.
Each of the next Q lines contains values for Δ as noted in the statement.
Output
You should print Q lines, each containing XΔ0.
