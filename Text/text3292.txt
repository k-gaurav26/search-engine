Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.
You are given an array a of length N and Q queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers, l and r. Answer each query with the following: if we take every subsequence of the elements with indices between l and r (inclusive) and write down their products, what will be the smallest missing positive integer?
A subsequence of an array is a sequence you obtain by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of the array. The product of the empty subsequence is defined to be 1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers, l and r, denoting the query's range.

Output
For each query, output the smallest missing subsequence product on a new line.
