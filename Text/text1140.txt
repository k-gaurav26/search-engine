Problem
You are given a string S of length N, which consists of digits from 0 to 9. You can apply the following operation to the string:

Choose an integer L with 1≤L≤N and apply Si​=(Si​+1)mod10 for each 1≤i≤L.

For example, if S=39590, then choosing L=3 and applying the operation yields the string S=406​90.
The prefix of string S of length l(1≤l≤∣S∣) is string S1​S2​…Sl​. A prefix of length l is called good if S1​=0,S2​=0,…,Sl​=0. Find the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string S by applying the given operation maximum K times.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.
The second line of each test case contains the string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string S by applying the given operation maximum K times.
