Pantelija was given a sequence of positive integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​. Let's define the gcd value of this sequence as the number of its non-empty contiguous subsequences with greatest common divisor strictly greater than 1. The greatest common divisor of any contiguous subsequence al​,al+1​,…,ar​ (1≤l≤r≤N) is the greatest positive integer which divides each element of this subsequence.
Pantelija wants to maximise the gcd value of this sequence. In order to do that, he may choose a valid index i, an integer b (1≤b≤5⋅105, since he does not like large numbers) and change the element ai​ to b. What is the maximum possible gcd value he can obtain?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the largest possible gcd value.
