Problem
Chef has a binary string S of length N.
He can perform the following operation on string S:

Select a substring of size M and flip all the characters of the selected substring, i.e., change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

There are Q queries of the following 2 types:

0: Append 0 to the front of string S.
1: Append 1 to the front of string S.

After each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make lexicographically smallest possible string from S. Note that queries are dependent. Thus, after each query, the string S gets updated.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N, M, and Q.
The second line of each test case contains the string S.
After that, Q lines follow. The ith line contains an integer X (0≤X≤1) - the ith query. For each query, you need to append X to the front of string S.

Output Format
For each test case, print Q lines. The ith line should contain the answer to the ith query.
