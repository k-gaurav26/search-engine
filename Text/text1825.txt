Problem
Corruption is on the rise in the country of Freedonia, Gru's home.
This corruption network can be represented in the form of a tree having N nodes and N−1 edges. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N, and the tree is rooted at node 1. These nodes represent the corrupt officials and each corrupt official works under some other corrupt official (except the Boss, who is represented by node 1).
Gru believes in divide and conquer and thinks that this network needs to be divided into as many sub-networks as possible. To achieve this, the following operation can be applied by the minions any number of times (even 0):
In one operation, the minions can select any one leaf node official (that is, an official who does not have any other official beneath him) in the graph and kill him along with all his ancestors. This operation deletes those nodes, along with all of their edges/connections from the graph. Hence after applying this operation on any tree, it breaks into some connected components which are also trees, which are the new sub-networks.
Now the minions are a bit lazy and will do the task someday, but they need to submit a report to Gru as soon as possible. Help the minions by finding out the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved.
Input:

First line will contain N, number of nodes in the tree.
Next N−1 lines contains 2 integers U, V denoting the endpoints of the ith edge.

Output:

Print the maximum number of connected components you can obtain after doing the operation any number of times.
