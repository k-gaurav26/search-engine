Problem
You have two binary strings A and B, both of length N. You have to merge both the binary strings to form a new binary string C of length 2⋅N. The relative order of characters in the original binary strings A and B should not change in the binary string C.
For example, if A=01011 and B=10100, one possible way to merge them to form C is: C=0101101100.
Minimize the number of inversions in the merged binary string C.
As a reminder, a pair of indices (i,j) is an inversion for binary string C if and only if 1≤i<j≤∣C∣, Ci​=1 and Cj​=0.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the length of the binary strings A and B.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string A.
The third line of each test case contains the binary string B.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of inversions in the merged binary string C.
