Anas is playing an amazing game on a grid with N rows and M columns. The rows are numbered 1 through N from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 through M from left to right.
Anas wants to destroy this grid. To do that, he wants to send two heroes from the top left cell to the bottom right cell:

The first hero visits cells in row-major order: (1,1)→(1,2)→…→(1,M)→(2,1)→(2,2)→…→(2,M)→…→(N,M).
The second hero visits cells in column-major order: (1,1)→(2,1)→…→(N,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→…→(N,2)→…→(N,M).

We know that each hero destroys the first cell he visits, rests in the next K cells he visits without destroying them, then destroys the next cell he visits, rests in the next K cells, destroys the next cell, and so on until he reaches (and rests in or destroys) the last cell he visits.
Anas does not know the value of K. Therefore, for each value of K between 0 and N⋅M−1 inclusive, he wants to calculate the number of cells that will be destroyed by at least one hero. Can you help him?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N⋅M space-separated integers as described above.
