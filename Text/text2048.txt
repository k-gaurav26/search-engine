A tree is defined as a connected, undirected graph with n vertices and n−1 edges. The distance between two vertices in a tree is equal to the number of edges on the unique simple path between them.
You are given two integers x and y. Construct a tree with the following properties:

The number of pairs of vertices with an even distance between them equals x.
The number of pairs of vertices with an odd distance between them equals y.

By a pair of vertices, we mean an ordered pair of two (possibly, the same or different) vertices.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two space-separated integers x and y.
Output
For each test case, if there is no tree satisfying the given properties, print "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, on the first line print "YES" (without quotes). Then print integer n denoting the number of vertices in the tree, followed by n−1 lines describing the edges of the tree in any order. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
