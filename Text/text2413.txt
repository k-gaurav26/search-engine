Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given two strings P and Q. Consider some uniformly randomly and independently chosen non-empty prefix X and non-empty suffix Y of P. A string Z is formed by concatenating X and Y in this order. Find the probability that Z is a substring of Q.
It can be shown that the answer can be represented as a fraction U/V, where U and V are non-negative integers and V is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute U⋅V−1 modulo 998,244,353, where V−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of V modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string P.
The second line contains a single string Q.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer U⋅V−1 modulo 998,244,353.
