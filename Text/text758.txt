Chef went to the store in order to buy one can of coke. In the store, they offer N cans of coke (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the current temperature of the i-th can is Ci​ and its price is Pi​.
After buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef M minutes to get home from the store.
The ambient temperature outside is K. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is t at some point in time:

if t>K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be t−1
if t<K−1, then one minute later, its temperature will be t+1
if K−1≤t≤K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be K

When Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between L and R (inclusive). Find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied or determine that there is no such can.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers N, M, K, L and R.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Ci​ and Pi​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the price of the can Chef should buy, or −1 if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.
