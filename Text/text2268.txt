Problem
You are given a tree. If we select 2 distinct nodes uniformly at random, what's the probability that the distance between these 2 nodes is a prime number?
Input Format
The first line contains a number N: the number of nodes in this tree.
The following N-1 lines contain pairs a[i] and b[i], which means there is an edge with length 1 between a[i] and b[i].
Output Format
Output a real number denote the probability we want.
You'll get accept if the difference between your answer and standard answer is no more than 10^-6.
