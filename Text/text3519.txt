Chef has n Ã— n array A of non-negative integers. He wants to divide this array by p-1 horizontal dividers and p-1 vertical dividers into p2 blocks such that maximum sum of elements of each block will be the smallest. 
More formally, Chef want to choose p-1 horizontal dividers 0 = h0 < h1 < ... < hp = n and  p-1 vertical dividers 0 = v0 < v1 < ... < vp = n to minimize the next value: 


Input

The first line of each test file contains two space-separated integers n and p denoting the size of array A and the number of horizontal and vertical dividers.
Each of next n lines contains n space-separated integers Ai, 1, Ai, 2, ..., Ai, n denoting the ith row of the array A. 

Output
The first line of output should contain p-1 space-separated integers h1, h2, ... hp-1 denoting the horizontal dividers.
The second line of output should contain p-1 space-separated integers v1, v2, ... vp-1 denoting the vertical dividers.
Scoring
Your score for each test case will be calculated by formula described above. Your goal is to minimize this score.
Your total score for the problem will be the sum of scores on all the test cases.
Your solution will be tested only on 20% of the test files during the contest and will be rejudged against 100% after the end of competition.
