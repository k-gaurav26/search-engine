Problem
Chef wants to make a purchase. For this, he needs X gold coins, but he has none at the moment.
Chef has N fixed deposits, the ith of which is worth Ai​ coins. He wants to open the minimum number of these deposits so that he has at least X coins.
You have to tell Chef the minimum number of fixed deposits he must open in order to have X coins, or say that this is impossible.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers — N and X, as described in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers — the ith of which is Ai​.

Output Format
For each test case, output one line containing the answer — the minimum number of FDs Chef must open to have at least X coins. If it is not possible for him to open FDs such that he has at least X coins, output −1.
