Problem
Read problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an undirected graph with N nodes and M edges. There are exactly K=2N(N−1)​−M unordered pairs (i,j) such that the edge (i,j) is not present in the graph. For each of these pairs, you can choose whether to add the edge (i,j) to the graph. Out of all 2K ways, find the number of ways in which each vertex has degree 2 in the final graph.
Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 998 244 353.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N, M, the number of nodes and the number of edges in the graph.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers u, v, denoting an edge between nodes u and v in the graph.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the number of ways in which all nodes of the final graph have degree 2, modulo 998 244 353.
