Problem
You are given integers N,M,K and N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
You can perform the following operation at most K times:

Choose any integer x such that 0≤x<2M. Then, for each 1≤i≤N, you can replace Ai​ with Ai​⊕x, or leave it unchanged.

What is the maximum value of A1​+A2​+…+AN​ that you can achieve after this process?
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N,M,K.
The second line of each test case contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum value of A1​+A2​+…+AN​ that you can achieve.
