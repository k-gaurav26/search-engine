Problem
The Chessboard Distance for any two points (X1​,Y1​) and (X2​,Y2​) on a Cartesian plane is defined as max(∣X1​−X2​∣,∣Y1​−Y2​∣).
You are given two points (X1​,Y1​) and (X2​,Y2​). Output their Chessboard Distance.
Note that, ∣P∣ denotes the absolute value of integer P. For example, ∣−4∣=4 and ∣7∣=7.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing 4 space separated integers - X1​,Y1​,X2​,Y2​ - as defined in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the chessboard distance between (X1​,Y1​) and (X2​,Y2​)
