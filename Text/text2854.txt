An integer x is said to be a Perfect Power if there exists positive integers a and b (i.e a, and b should be ≥1) such that x=ab+1.
Given an integer n, find the closest Perfect Power to n. If there are multiple Perfect Powers equidistant from n and as close as possible to n, find the smallest one.
More formally, find the smallest integer x such that x is a Perfect Power and ∣n−x∣≤∣n−y∣ over all Perfect Powers y.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n.

Output Format
For each test case, print in a separate line, the smallest x such that x is a perfect power and ∣n−x∣ is minimum.
