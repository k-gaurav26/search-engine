Problem
There is a grid containing N rows and N columns. The cell at the ith row from the top and jth column from the left is a passable space if Si,j​ is '.' and a blocked cell if Si,j​ is '#'.
Chef is at the top-left cell and wants to reach the bottom-right cell. Chef can move one cell down, or right to a passable cell. He can't leave the grid. If Chef is at the cell (i,j), he can collect Ai,j​ coins.
Now, Chef has a special ability using which he can make all the blocked cells in a path of length K into passable cells. Chef uses this ability before moving from the top-left cell. It is possible that some of the cells in the chosen K length path are already passable. More formally, Chef can choose a sequence of K cells such that for each i (1≤i<K), the ith and (i+1)th cells of the sequence are adjacent and make all these K cells passable.
Find the maximum amount of coins Chef can collect in the path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell. Print −1 if it is impossible to reach the bottom-right cell.
Note: Two cells are considered to be adjacent if they share a common side. The cell (i,j) has four adjacent cells i.e. the cells (i−1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j−1) and (i,j+1). It is guaranteed that the top-left cell of the grid is a passable cell.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.
N  lines follow. The ith of these lines contains a string Si​ of length N. The jth character of Si​ is '.' if the cell (i,j) is passable, or '#' if it is a blocked cell.
Next N lines follow. The ith of these lines contains N space-separated integers  Ai,j​, denoting the number of coins in the cell (i,j).

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum amount of coin Chef can collect in the path or −1 if it is impossible to reach the bottom-right cell.
