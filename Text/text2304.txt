Problem
Krillin has died yet again. Goku and Picollo must find a dragon ball in order to resurrect him. Kami gives them a quiz to solve in return for the dragon ball.
He gives them an array A (having 1 based indexing) of N integers and he'll ask them Q queries. The array is basically a frequency table which represents some data. It signifies that i occurs A[i] times in the data. The queries can be of two types -
1 L R
2 i x
First query - They must find the mode and median in the range L to R where L and R are inclusive (L and R are indices of the array) and return their LCM. It is guaranteed that there will be an unique mode.
Second query- The element at ith index must be updated to x.
1 represents the first query and 2 represents the second query.
Note: Use greatest integer function for computing the median. This means that the median should be the floor value if the computed median is a fraction.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N, Q separated by a single space.
The second line of each test case contains N integers denoting elements of the array separated by single spaces.
The next Q lines contain respective queries.

Output:
For each test case, print results of only the first type of queries in separate lines.
