Problem
Given is a sequence A of length N.
Define f(i,j) to be the number of distinct elements in Ai​,Ai+1​,…,Aj​.
You need to process Q queries of the following two types:

1 x y — set Ax​=y.
2 k — print i=1∑k​j=i∑k​f(i,j).

Input Format

The first line of input contains two integers N and Q — the size of the array and the number of queries.
The second line of input contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Then, Q lines follow, describing queries in the format given in the statement.

Output Format
For each type 2 query, print the answer to it on a new line.
