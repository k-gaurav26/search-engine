Problem
You are given a grid with 2 rows and N columns containing distinct integers. The number in the i-th row and j-th column is denoted by Ai,j​. In one operation, you can swap numbers in any two cells which share a side.
For a binary string S of length N, let's define f(S) as follows:

f(S) is the smallest number of swaps required to achieve a state of board in which A1,i​<A2,i​ if Si​=1, and A1,i​>A2,i​ if Si​=0, for each i from 1 to N.

It's easy to show that it's possible to achieve any state of the board by swapping adjacent elements, so f(S) is always defined.
Find the sum of f(S) over all 2N binary strings S of length N.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Then two lines follow, the i-th line contains N space-separated integers Ai,1​,Ai,2​,…,Ai,N​.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of f(S) over all binary strings S of length N.
