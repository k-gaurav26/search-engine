Problem
Dazzler has a task for you.
Given two positive integers A and B, find two positive integers i and j such that:

gcd(i,j)>1;
A≤i<j≤B;
The value (i+j) is minimum possible.

If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. If no such pair exists, print −1.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers A and B.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line two space-separated integers i and j satisfying all the conditions. If no such pair exists, print −1.
