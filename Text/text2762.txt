Sereja has an array A of N integers: A[1], A[2], …, A[N]. Sereja also has an integer D.

Sereja calls a permutation P[1], P[2], …, P[N] as good if the following conditions hold.
A[P[1]] + D > A[P[2]],
A[P[2]] + D > A[P[3]],
⋮
A[P[N-1]] + D > A[P[N]].


Sereja wants to sequentially perform M single-element replacement operations on the array. Each of these operations consists of choosing an index p of the array, and replacing A[p] with a new value v. Your task is to keep track of the number of good permutations P[1], P[2], …, P[N] after each operation.

Input
The first line of input contains the integers N and D described above. The next line contains N integers A[1], A[2], …, A[N]. The line after this contains a single integer, M. Each of the next M lines contain two numbers p and v, implying that the new value of A[p] is v.
Output
Output M lines. The ith line should contain the number of good permutations modulo 109 + 7 after we perform the ith replacement operation.
