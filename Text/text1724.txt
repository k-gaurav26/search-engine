Problem
Initially, there is a magical stone of mass 2N lying at the origin of the number line. For the next N seconds, the following event happens:

Let us define the decomposition of a magical stone as follows: If there is a magical stone of mass M>1 lying at coordinate X, then it decomposes into two magical stones, each of mass 2M​ lying at the coordinates X−1 and X+1 respectively. The original stone of mass M gets destroyed in the process.
Each second, all the magical stones undergo decomposition simultaneously.

Note that there can be more than one stone at any coordinate X.
Given a range [L,R], find out the number of stones present at each of the coordinates in the range [L,R]. As the number of stones can be very large, output them modulo (109+7).
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers N, L and R, as described in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line a total of (R−L+1) space-separated integers. The ith integer will denote the number of stones present at X=(L+i−1) coordinate.
As the number of stones can be very large, output them modulo (109+7).
