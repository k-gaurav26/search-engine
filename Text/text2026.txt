Problem
Recently, Chef has noticed that he is becoming fatter than ever. It is not surprising, as Chef is eating a lot of the food he is cooking. Therefore, he has been doing exercises for the last N days (numbered 1 through N). For some of these days, Chef remembers for how many minutes he exercised. You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. For each valid i, if Ai​≥0, then Chef exercised for Ai​ minutes on the i-th day; otherwise, Chef forgot how long he exercised on the i-th day and Ai​=−1. Note that Chef could only have exercised for an integer non-negative number of minutes on each day, including the days he does not remember.
Chef can also compare how long he exercised on each two consecutive days. You are given a string S with length N−1. For each valid i, the i-th character of S is one of the following:

'>' if Chef exercised for strictly more minutes on the i-th day than on the (i+1)-th day
'=' if Chef exercised for an equally long time on the i-th day and on the (i+1)-th day
'<' if Chef exercised for strictly more minutes on the (i+1)-th day than on the i-th day

Chef is doubting his memory, so he wants you to check if the information is consistent, i.e. if there is a way to determine for how many minutes Chef exercised on each day he does not remember such that the string S describes the correct comparison operators.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains a single string S.

Output
For each test case, if the information on the input is inconsistent, print a single line containing the string "NO", otherwise output  "YES"
