Given a binary string S consisting of 0′s and 1′s, find whether there exists a rightwise  circular rotation of the string such that every 2 adjacent 1′s are separated by at most C 0′s.
Note: The last occurrence of 1 in the rotated string won't have any 1 next to it, i.e, first and the last ones in the string are not considered to be adjacent.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of two lines of input.
First line contains two space separated integers N,C, length of the string and the upper limit on a number of 0′s between 2 adjacent 1′s.
Second line contains the binary string S.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "YES" if there exists a rightwise circular rotation of string satisfying the criteria and "NO" if it doesn't exist.
Note: The output is case-insensitive ― each letter may be printed in upper case or lower case.
