Problem
You are given an integer N. Find another integer X(X>N) such that the following conditions are satisfied :

X is not a multiple of N.
The value  ∣gcd(N,X)−lcm(N,X)∣ is as small as possible.

If there are multiple answers for X, print any.
For reference, gcd(u,v) is the greatest common divisor between u and v, while lcm(u,v) refers to the least common multiple.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each testcase, print any suitable X satisfying the above two conditions for the given N.
