Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese .
 
In this problem you will have to implement a simple editor. The editor maintains the content of a string S and have two following functions:

"+ i x": insert a string x into the current string S after the i'th character of the S (we use 1-indexing in this problem). When i equals to 0 it mean we add x at the beginning of S.
"? i len": Print the sub-string of length len starting at position i'th of S.

At the beginning, the editor holds an empty string. There will be Q queries of the two types described above.

 
Input
The first line contains the integer Q.
Each line in the next Q lines contains one query.

 
Output
For each query of the second type, print out the answer sub-string in one line.
