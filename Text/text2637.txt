You are given a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N). The tree is rooted at node r. For each node, find the number of walks with length K from the root to this node modulo 998244353.
A walk from node a to node b with length K is defined as a sequence of nodes (u1​,u2​,…,uK+1​), where u1​=a,uK+1​=b and for each valid i, there is an edge between nodes ui​ and ui+1​. Two walks (u1​,u2​,…,uK+1​) and (v1​,v2​,…,vK+1​) are considered different if there is a valid index i such that ui​=vi​.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting an edge between nodes x and y.
The last line contains two space-separated integers r and K.

Output
Print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of them should denote the number of walks from node r to node i with length K, modulo 998244353.
