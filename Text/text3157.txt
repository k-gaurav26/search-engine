Find K distinct numbers in the range [1,N] such that the bitwise XOR of all the numbers is maximized. Print any set of these numbers that maximize the XOR.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers N, K.
