Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

Sereja has an integer number A that doesn't contain zeroes in its decimal form. 
Also he has N integers B[1], B[2], ..., B[N]. 


Let us first define function f for a number A as follows. 
.


Now he has to reorder the digits of A such that f(A) is minimum. 
Please help him in finding most optimal A.
 
Input

First line contain a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Then T tests follow.  
First line of each test case contains an integer A. 
Next line contains an integer N. 
Next line contains N integers B[1], B[2], ..., B[N].  

Output
For each test case, output optimal value of A after reordering digits in a single line.
