 Chef has just been introduced to functions and he has been experimenting a lot with the different kinds of functions. In the process, the chef has come up with an interesting problem for you. 
 Chef defines a function  root(i, x)  which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the  i th root of a positive integer  x . For example,  root(2, 4)  is   2  and  root(2, 2)  is  1 .  
 Now the chef defines another function  val(x, A, N)  as follows :  val(x, A, N) =  root(1, x)*A[1]  +  root(2, x)*A[2] +  ...  + root(N, x)*A[N]  
where  A  is an array of integers of size  N  (indexed from 1 onwards)  and  x  is a positive integer.

 You are given the array  A  and its size  N . You need to find out the value of  val(x, A, N)  for several values of  x . Since this number can be very large, print the result modulo  109 + 7 .

Input
 The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers N and  Q  denoting the size of array A and the number of queries. The second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers where the ith integer represents A[i]. The third line of each test case consists of Q space separated integers denoting the value of  x  for the ith query.

Output
 For each test case, print in a single line  Q  integers, where the ith integer represents the answer to the ith  query. ( i.e  val(x, A, N) % ( 109 + 7 )  )
