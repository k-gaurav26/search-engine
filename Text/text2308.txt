Problem
You are given an array A of length N.
You can perform the following operation on the array, as long as it has more than one element:

Choose any two adjacent elements, remove them from the array and insert their sum at that position.
Formally, if the current length of the array is ∣A∣, you can choose an index 1≤i<∣A∣, and transform the array into [A1​,A2​,…,Ai−1​,Ai​+Ai+1​,Ai+2​,…,AN​].

Note that after each operation, the length of array decreases by exactly 1.
Print the minimum number of operations to be applied on array A such that all the elements in the resulting array are equal. See sample explanation for more details.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.

The first line contains an integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, the elements of array A.



Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements equal.
