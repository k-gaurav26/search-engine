Problem
Given two integers A and B.

Let P denote a sequence of N prime numbers such that the sum of the sequence is A.
Let Q denote a sequence of M prime numbers such that the sum of the sequence is B.

Let X denote the maximum absolute difference between Pi​ and Qj​ among all valid pairs (i,j) such that (1≤i≤N) and (1≤j≤M).
Find the minimum possible value of X over all possible sequences P and Q.
More formally, for all possible sequences P and Q, find the minimum value of max(∣Pi​−Qj​∣), where (1≤i≤N) and (1≤j≤M).
Print −1 if any one of the sequences cannot be formed.
Note that, ∣X∣ denotes the absolute value of a number X. For example, ∣−4∣=4 and ∣7∣=7.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two integers A and B.

Output Format
For each test case, find the minimum possible value of the maximum absolute difference between Pi​ and Qj​ for (1≤i≤N) and (1≤j≤M). If any of the sequences can not be formed, print −1 instead.
