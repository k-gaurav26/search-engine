Problem
Alice recently converted all the positive integers from 1 to 2N−1 (both inclusive) into binary strings and stored them in an array S.  Note that the binary strings do not have leading zeroes.
While she was out, Bob sorted all the elements of S in lexicographical increasing order.
Let Si​ denotes the ith string in the sorted array.
Alice defined a function F such that F(Si​) is equal to the count of 1 in the string Si​.
For example, F(101)=2 and F(1000)=1.
Given a positive integer K, find the value of ∑i=1K​F(Si​).
String P is lexicographically smaller than string Q if one of the following satisfies:

P is a prefix of Q and P=Q.
There exists an index i such that P_i &lt; Q_i and for all j<i,  Pj​=Qj​.

Input Format

The first line will contain an integer T - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and K.

Output Format
For each test case, output the value ∑i=1K​F(Si​).
