Problem
There are N people standing in a line from left to right. The i-th person from the left has a height Hi​. H is a permutation of 1 to N.
First, you must assign each of them a shirt with the letter L or R on it. Then you may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose a person with L on their shirt and move them to the left end of the line.
Choose a person with R on their shirt and move them to the right end of the line.

For example, if H=[4,1,2,3] and we assign the shirts to the people as [(4,R),(1,L),(2,L),(3,R)], then if we move person 1 to the right end of the line the arrangement of people becomes [(1,L),(2,L),(3,R),(4,R)]
An assignment of shirts is called good if it is possible to sort the people in the line in non-decreasing order of height from left to right by using this operation zero or more times.
How many good assignments of shirts exist? Since this number may be large, print it modulo 109+7.
One assignment of shirts is different from another assignment if there exists at least one person who is assigned a shirt with a different letter on it.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the number of people.
The second line contains N space-separated integers H1​,H2​,…,HN​ - the heights of the N people.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of good assignments of shirts modulo 109+7.
