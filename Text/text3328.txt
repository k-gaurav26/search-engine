Problem
Chef has a (0-indexed) binary string S of length N such that N is a power of 2.
Chef wants to find the number of pairs (i,j) such that:

0≤i,j<N
Si∣j​=Si&amp;j​

(Here ∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation and &amp; denotes the bitwise AND operation)
Can you help Chef to do so?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the string S (N is a power of 2).
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions.
