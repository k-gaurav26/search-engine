There is a full-scale war taking place in Treeland. Chef needs to travel between cities in Treeland to work, but during the war, it is not safe.
In Treeland, there are N cities (numbered 1 through N) and N−1 bidirectional roads connecting them in such a way that Chef can reach each city from any other city using these roads. Each road is occupied by a unique faction that assigned a positive integer code to it.
Let f(A,B) denote the greatest positive integer which divides the code of each road on the shortest path between cities A and B (the GCD of these codes). If Chef wants to go from city A to city B safely, he needs to pay f(A,B) units of money.
Since Chef is not sure between which pairs of cities he is going to travel, he wants to know
S=i=1∑N​j=i+1∑N​f(i,j).
Help Chef calculate S.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers X, Y and Z denoting that cities X and Y are connected by a road with code Z.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer S.
