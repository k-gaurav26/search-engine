Chef likes trees a lot. He has a weighted rooted tree T rooted at node 1. There are N nodes in the tree numbered from 1 to N. Each node v has a value Av associated with it. Let's call ugliness of path between nodes u and v - C(u, v) as bitwise XOR of all values on path. Let's call ugliness of node v maximal ugliness among all the paths which lies in subtree v. For each node find ugliness of it.

Input
The first line contains one integer T, denoting the number of the test cases. 
First line of each test case contains one integer N. 
Second line contains N space-separated integers denoting Av - the values associated with nodes.
Next N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers u, v denoting the nodes connected by an edge.
Output
For each test case for each node in range from 1 to N, output its ugliness in a single line.
