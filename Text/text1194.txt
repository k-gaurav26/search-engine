Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​ of positive integers and an integer K. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

choose an index j between 1 and N inclusive
choose a positive divisor d of Aj​ such that d≤K
divide Aj​ by d

Determine if it is possible to modify the sequence A in such a way that it would satisfy the following condition: there is no positive integer strictly greater than 1 which divides every element of A. (In other words, the greatest common divisor of all elements of A should be 1.)
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the GCD of all elements of A equal to 1 or "NO" if it is impossible.
