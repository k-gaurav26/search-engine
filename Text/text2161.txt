Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
A pair of non-negative integers (A,B) is called and-pair if A & B = B, i.e., bitwise-and of A and B is equal to B. Similarly, a tuple of K non-negative integers (A1,A2,A3 .. AK) is called and-tuple if Ai & Ai+1 = Ai+1 for 1≤i≤K-1.
Given two integers N and K, how many and-tuples of size K exist such that the sum of the elements of the tuple is N?
Input
First line contains T, the number of testcases, then T lines follow. Each of the following lines contain two space-separated integers K and N.
Output
For each testcase, print a single line containing the answer. Since the number can be quite large, print the answer modulo 1000000009.
