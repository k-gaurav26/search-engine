Problem
Chef has an array A having N elements. Chef wants to make all the elements of the array equal by repeating the following move.

Choose any integer K between 1 and N (inclusive). Then choose K distinct indices i1​,i2​,…,iK​, and increase the values of Ai1​​,Ai2​​,…,AiK​​ by 1.

Find the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal.
Input Format

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in A.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal.
