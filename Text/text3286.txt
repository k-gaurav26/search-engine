Problem
Chef's professor gave him homework to find a permutation of length 2N such that each integer from 0 to 2Nâˆ’1 appears exactly once in the permutation and the maximum bitwise XOR of any even length subarray is minimized.
Chef wonders how many such permutations are there. Help Chef to find out the number of permutations modulo (109+7), satisfying the above conditions and also help him find one such permutation.
Input Format

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format

For each test case, print two lines of output.
In the first line, print the number of permutations modulo (109+7), for which maximum bitwise xor of any even-length subarray is minimized.
In the next line, print 2N space-separated numbers denoting any such permutation.
