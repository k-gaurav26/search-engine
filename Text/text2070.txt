Problem
The Big Billion day has arrived and Ross has N  items in his mind which he wants to purchase.
After purchasing Ross found that he has total of M type items from 1 to M.
Now to distinguish the items from each other he wants to arrange them in such a way that items of same type occur continuously.
For this he can select any K ( 0 <= K \lt= N ) number of items and permute them. The other N−K elements remain untouched.
Can you help him to find the minimum value of K for which this is possible?
Input:

The first line of the input contains two space separated integer N and M
The second line contains N space-separated integers which denotes the type of items he has bought as
A1​, A2​, . . . . . AN​ .

Output:
Print a single line containing one integer —  minimum value of K for which items of same type occurs continuously.
