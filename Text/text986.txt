Problem
A permutation of length N is an array of N integers (P1​,P2​,…,PN​) where every integer from 1 to N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. The weight of a subsegment containing the elements (Pl​,Pl+1​,…,Pr​) is defined as follows:  W(l,r)=(r−l+1)⋅l≤i≤rmin​(Pi​)
where 1≤l≤r≤N and l≤i≤rmin​(Pi​) denotes the minimum element of the subsegment.
You are given two integers N and X. You need to determine if there exists a permutation of length N such that it contains at least one subsegment having weight X?
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,X - the length of the permutation and the weight parameter mentioned in the question respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if there exists a permutation of length N having at least one subsegment with a weight of X, otherwise print NO.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).
