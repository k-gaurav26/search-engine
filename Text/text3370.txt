Problem

There are the big enemies for all chefs, that is, Gs (the plural form of G).
Chef Ciel find N Gs in her restaurant.
Ciel is very scared, and she is going to kill the Gs by using insecticides.
Here M insecticides are available,
and the price of the j-th insecticide is Cj, and she can use the j-th insecticide for all N Gs if she buys it.
Unfortunately Gs may have resistance to insecticides, so Gs may be still alive after using some insecticides.
But we know that if Ciel use the j-th insecticide, the i-th G will be dead with the probability Pi,j%, and these are statistically independent.


Chef Ciel would like to buy some insecticides, and then, Ciel may use the insecticides one by one.
Ciel hopes that the i-th G will be dead with a probability at least 90%, for all i, after using all insecticides which she buys.


Your work is selecting a cheaper (cheapest is not necessary) set of distinct insecticides which she buys.
Don't forget that the set must kill the i-th G with a probability at least 90% for all i.

Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow.
The first line for each test case has 2 integers N and M.
The next line has M integers C1, C2, ..., CM.
Then next N lines have M integers Pi,j, that is the j-th integer of the i-th line.

Output

For each test case, you should print two lines.
The first line should have an integer K, the number of insecticides which Ciel buys.
The second line should have K integers, the numbers of insecticides which Ciel buys, in ascending order.
