Problem
Read problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are three friends; let's call them A, B, C. They made the following statements:

A: "I have x Rupees more than B."
B: "I have y rupees more than C."
C: "I have z rupees more than A."

You do not know the exact values of x,y,z. Instead, you are given their absolute values, i.e. X=∣x∣, Y=∣y∣ and Z=∣z∣. Note that x, y, z may be negative; "having −r rupees more" is the same as "having r rupees less".
Find out if there is some way to assign amounts of money to A, B, C such that all of their statements are true.
