Problem
Andrew likes strings very much.
He has two strings A and B of N lower alphabet letters. We denote S[i, j] as the substring from ith to jth characters of string S.
Andrew is interested in the number of such fours of integers (LA, RA, LB, RB), where 1 ≤ LA ≤ RA ≤ N, 1 ≤ LB ≤ RB ≤ N, and RA − LA = RB − LB, such that the Hamming distance between substrings A[LA, RA] and B[LB, RB] is not greater than K. Here the Hamming distance between two strings of the same length is the number of unequal characters on the same positions of strings.
Help him and find this number.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K. The second line contains string A, and the third line contains string B.
Output
For each test case, output an integer, denoting the number of fours (LA, RA, LB, RB) satisfying the conditions described in the problem statements.
