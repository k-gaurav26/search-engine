Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
The problem is completely unrelated to its problem code :).
Let us build an infinite string D that is simply a concatenation of the decimal representations of all positive integers without leading zeros. In other words, D = 12345678910111213141...
You are given a string S. Find the position of the first occurrence of S in D that satisfies one additional constraint: at least one integer that was concatenated to form D occurs entirely within S.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string of digits S.
It is guaranteed that S will occur satisfying the given condition somewhere in D.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimal position number where S occurs in D under the given condition, modulo 109+7. Consider the string to be 1-indexed: '1' is in position 1.
