Read problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.
You are given N integers: A1, A2, ..., AN. You need to count the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N and Ai | Aj ≤ max(Ai, Aj).
Note: Ai | Aj refers to bitwise OR.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer: N
The second line of each testcase contains N integers: A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for that test case.
