Problem
Chef Avi likes the number K. Given a list of N integers, help him find the sum of all distinct numbers repeating exactly K times. Each of those numbers should be considered only once in the sum, not K times.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines:
The first line contains two space-separated integers N,K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers.### Output:
For each testcase, print the sum of all numbers occurring exactly K times. If there is no such number, print -1 instead.
