Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is not very good with geometric problems, and he, therefore, asks you to solve one of them. He has N red points and M black points, and Q queries on them. In each query, he will give you a subset of red points, you have to find out number of black points lying strictly inside the convex polygon formed by using the given subset as vertices.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers — N and M — denoting the number of red and black points, respectively. The next N lines contain two space-separated integers each denoting the coordinates of red points, with the ith line describing the ith point. Analogously, the next M lines contain two space-separated integers each denoting the coordinates of the black points. The next line contain one integer Q denoting the number of polygons. Each of the next Q lines contains a polygon in the form k i1 i2 … ik. Here, k is the number of vertices of the polygon, and i1, i2, …, ik are the indices of red points which form the polygon, in a clockwise order.

Output
For each query, output a new line containing the answer to it.
