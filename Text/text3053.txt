You are given a simple undirected graph G with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges. Consider the following process performed for a fixed number of seconds:

Each second, choose an unordered pair of vertices (a,b) uniformly randomly (there are N(N−1)/2 such pairs).
If the edge (a,b) is present in the graph, remove it. Otherwise, add it to the graph.

We are interested in the number of spanning trees in the resulting graph. Two spanning trees are distinct if they contain different sets of edges. Note that the resulting graph may be disconnected, in which case the number of spanning trees is 0. The initial graph does not have to be connected either.
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given a time T and you have to find the expected number of spanning trees in the graph after the process described above is performed for T seconds, modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N,M and Q.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.
Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer T describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the expected number of spanning trees modulo 109+7.
