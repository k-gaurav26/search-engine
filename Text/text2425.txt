Problem
Arya is planning to go back to Winterfell. In order to reach there and survive, she must collect maximum stars from a maze. The maze is in the form of a grid of size m×n. Each cell is either blank, has a star or has a stone.
She starts from (1,1) to reach (m,n) using right and bottom moves and then she returns to (1,1) using top and left moves.
The only constraint is that if she visits some cells in a particular row in the whole journey (forward and backward), then maximum distance between any pair of visited cells (forward and backward) for every row is x, where x is given in the input. Distance between (i,j) and (i,k) is ∣k−j∣.
Also note that she cannot go into the cells with a stone.
Tell the maximum stars that can be collected by Arya.
Input:

First line will contain three integers: m, number of rows, n, number of columns and x, the distance constraint.
Next m lines contain the grid. Each line contains '.', '*' or '#' denoting empty cell, star or stone. The cells (1,1) or (m,n) can have stones.

Output:
Print the maximum number of stars that can be collected by Arya. If it is not possible to reach (m,n) from (1,1), then print -1.
