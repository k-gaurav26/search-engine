Chef is working with lines on a 2-D plane.
He knows that every line on a plane can be clearly defined by three coefficients A, B and C: any point (x,Â y) lies on the line if and only if A * x + B * y + C = 0.
Let's call a set of lines to be perfect if there does not exist a point that belongs to two or more distinct lines of the set.
He has a set of lines on a plane and he wants to find out the size of the largest perfect subset of this set.
Input
The first line of input contains one integers T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one integer N denoting number of lines.
Next N lines contain 3 space-separated integers each denoting coefficients A, B and C respectively.
Output
For each test case output the cardinality of the largest perfect subset in a single line.
