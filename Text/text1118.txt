Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.
You are given an array A with N integers. You have to tell Chef whether this array is closed under multiplication.
We say that an array is closed under multiplication if, for all sequences 1≤S1​<S2​<⋯<Sk​≤N,  there exists 1≤x≤N such that AS1​​⋅AS2​​⋅⋯⋅ASk​​=Ax​.
Output 1 if it is closed, and 0 otherwise.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer - N
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - the ith of which is Ai​

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer on a new line. Output 1 if A is closed under multiplication, and 0 otherwise.
