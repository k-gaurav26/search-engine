Chefina is playing with ranges. There are N ranges [l1​,r1​],[l2​,r2​],…,[lN​,rN​]. Chefina wants to divide the ranges into two non-empty subsets in such a way that each range is in exactly one subset and whenever two ranges have a common point, they are in the same subset.
Since this could be difficult to achieve, Chefina can delete any number of ranges (possibly zero) and then divide the remaining ranges into such non-empty subsets. She wants to know whether it is possible to achieve her task after deleting some ranges and if it is possible, she also wants to know the minimum number of ranges she needs to delete to achieve it.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li​ and ri​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of ranges to delete, or −1 if it is impossible to delete some ranges and divide the remaining ranges into two non-empty subsets.
