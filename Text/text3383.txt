Problem
Given a (multi)set of N strings, each 8 characters long. (Note that the set may contain duplicate strings). Answer M queries. Each query has two parameters: S and d, where S is a 8 characters long string. You have to find how many strings from the original set are at  edit distance of exactly d from S.
Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
Input
The first line contains the integers M and N respectively.The following N lines contain one string each.These are followed by M lines each having two space separated query parameters S and d
Output
A single integer per line. Denoting the number of strings in the given set which are at an edit distance of d from the corresponding query string.
