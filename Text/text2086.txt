Chef has a string S with length N. He also has M other strings P1​,P2​,…,PM​, which are called patterns. The characters in the strings are indexed from 1.
Chef was wondering if he could find the M patterns in the string S in the given order. That is, he wanted to know whether it is possible to choose M ranges, denoted by [li​,ri​] for each i (1≤i≤M), such that 1≤l1​≤r1​<l2​≤r2​<…<lM​≤rM​≤N and for each valid i, the substring Sli​​,Sli​+1​,…,Sri​​ equals Pi​.
As this problem was too easy for Chef, he decided to make a harder one. A permutation p=(p1​,p2​,…,pM​) of integers 1 through M is called a matchable permutation if Chef can reorder the M patterns into Pp1​​,Pp2​​,…,PpM​​ and then find them in S, in this order (in the same way as described above).
Can you help Chef find the number of matchable permutations?
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains a single string S.
M lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines contains a single string Pi​.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the number of matchable permutations.
