Problem
You are given two integers N and K.
Construct an array A consisting of N distinct positive integers such that the following conditions are met:

1≤Ai​≤2⋅104;
There exists no subsequence of A with sum K.

It can be shown that the answer always exists.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T: the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers N and K - as mentioned in the statement.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated elements: A1​,A2​,…,AN​. If there are multiple answers, you may print any.
