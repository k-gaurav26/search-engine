You are given two integers N and K. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): change N to N−K, i.e. subtract K from N. Find the smallest non-negative integer value of N you can obtain this way.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the smallest value you can get.
