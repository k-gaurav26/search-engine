Problem
Read problem statements in Russian and Mandarin Chinese.
Find the minimum integer K such that sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of all integers from 1 to K is greater than or equal to N.
The bits are enumerated from left to right starting from the leftmost set bit i.e. the most significant bit. For example, binary representation of 77 is 1001101. Bits present on 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th positions in the binary representation are 1,0,1,1 respectively. So sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of 77 is 1+0+1+1=3.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, an integer N.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum possible value of K.
