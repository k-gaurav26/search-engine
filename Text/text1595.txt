Problem
Chef received an array A of N integers as a valentine's day present. He wants to maximize the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence by choosing a subarray and adding a fixed integer X to all its elements.
More formally, Chef wants to maximize the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of A by performing the following operation at most once:

Pick 3 integers L,R and X (1≤L≤R≤N, X∈Z) and assign Ai​:=Ai​+X ∀ i∈[L,R].

Find the length of the longest strictly increasing sequence Chef can obtain after performing the operation at most once.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N, the size of the array.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, where the ith integer denotes Ai​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the length of the longest strictly increasing sequence Chef can obtain.
