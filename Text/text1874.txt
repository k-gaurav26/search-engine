Problem
 Read problems statements in English, Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.
Given an array A1,A2...AN, you have to print the size of the largest contiguous subarray such that 
LCM of all integers in that subarray is equal to the product of all integers in that subarray.
Formally, For a subarray Ai,Ai+1...Aj where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N to be valid: LCM(Ai,Ai+1...Aj) should be equal to Ai*Ai+1*...*Aj. You have to print the size of the largest valid subarray.
If no subarray satisfies output -1.
Note:A single element is not considered a subarray according to definition in this problem.
Input
First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N in one line followed by N integers in next line.
Output
For each testcase, print the required answer in one line.
