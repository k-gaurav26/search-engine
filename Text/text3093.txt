Let's define a function P(A) for a sequence A as the number of ways to divide A into contiguous subsequences such that each element of A belongs to exactly one of these subsequences and the sum of elements of each subsequence is between L and R inclusive.
For each integer n between 1 and N inclusive, solve the following problem: Consider a random sequence A with length n where each element is an integer between 1 and K chosen uniformly randomly and independently. Find the expected value of P(A).
For each valid n, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 is the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, K, L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353 for n=i.
