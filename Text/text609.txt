Problem
"I have only one rule, never submit partially correct code" -Barney Stinson
The religious act which Barney and his friends hold most sacred, XORING the natural numbers in the given range. This time Barney is a bit busy with picking up some girls, so he asked you to help him. He gave you two numbers L and R, you have to find if XOR of all the numbers in range L to R (L,R both inclusive) is odd or even.
Warning!! Large Input-Output. Please use Fast IO.
Input:

The first line will contain T, number of testcases.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers L,R.

Output:
For each testcase, in the new line print "Odd" if the XOR in the range is odd, else print "Even".
