Problem
Chef, who is a chef by profession as well, has created N pies (enumerated 1 through N) and has placed them in a row. Now he wants to taste all the pies, but by following a rather peculiar order of tasting.
At each step, he chooses (uniformly randomly and independently) either the current leftmost pie or the rightmost pie, and eats that pie.
For example, if N=7, then one valid order of tasting the pies is (1,2,7,3,4,6,5). However, (1,2,7,6,4,5,3) is not a valid order.
Chef can't wait to taste all the pies, so for each i (1≤i≤N), he wants to know the expected value of the number of steps he'll need to eat the ith pie.
It can be shown that each expected value can be expressed as a fraction QP​. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 109+7, where Q−1 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of Q under 109+7
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer N — the number of pies.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers, the ith of which is the expected number of steps Chef needs to eat the ith pie.
