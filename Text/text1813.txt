Chef's loves his dog so much! Once his dog created two strings a and b each of length n consisting of digits 1 and 2, and even a problem about them!
Chef's Dog will tell by barking if a string x (also containing only digits 1 and 2 and with length N) is good or not by performing the following actions.

It starts at first digit of the string, i.e. at i = 1. 
It can move from digit i to either i - 1 or i + 1 if xi equals 1 and the corresponding digits exist. 
It can move from digit i to either i - 2 or i + 2 if xi equals 2 and the corresponding digits exist. 
It must visit each digit exactly once. 
It must finish at the last digit (XN). 


Chef's dog wants to make both the strings a and b good by choosing some subset S (possibly empty) of indices of set {1, 2, ..., n} and swapping each index i ϵ S between string a and b, i.e. swapping ai and bi. Can you find how many such subsets S exist out there? As the answer could be large, output it modulo 109 + 7.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line contains string a.
The second line contains string b.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing answer of the problem.
