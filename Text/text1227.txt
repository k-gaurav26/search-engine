Problem
Alice is teaching Bob maths via a game called N-guesser.
Alice has a positive integer N which Bob needs to guess. She gives him two pieces of information with which to do this:

A positive integer X, which denotes the sum of divisors of N.
Two positive integers A and B, which denote that the sum of reciprocals of divisors of N is A/B.

Bob either needs to guess N or tell that no such number exists.
It can be shown that if a valid N exists, it is unique.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers X,A,B.

Output Format
For each test case, output a new line containing the answer — Alice's number N, or −1 if no such number exists.
