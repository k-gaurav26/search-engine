Problem Statement
Levy's conjecture, named after Hyman Levy, states that all odd integers greater than 5 can be represented as the sum of an odd prime number and an even semiprime. To put it algebraically, 2n + 1 = p + 2q always has a solution in primes p and q (not necessary to be distinct) for n > 2. (Source: Wikipedia)
In this problem, given a positive integer N (not necessary to be odd integer greater than 5). Your task is to calculate how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of exactly one line containing an integer N.
