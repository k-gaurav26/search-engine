Problem
Read problem statements in Russian
Chef has a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. In one operation, Chef can choose one index i (1≤i≤N) and change Ai​ to Aip​, where p=max(0,⌈2Ai​​⌉−1).
Help Chef find the smallest number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even, or −1 if it is impossible.
