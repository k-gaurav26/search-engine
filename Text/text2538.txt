Problem

Consider a bijective function ƒ
f:1,2,3,…,n→1,2,3,…,n


We have M  different color. We have to associate a color to every x∈1,2,3,...n with one of the color such that x andƒ(ƒ(x)) has same  color .

Let G be an array, where G[x] = pair(ƒ[x], color[x]). 
Find the number of distinct arrays G modulo 1000000007.
Input Format:
First and the only line of the input, contains 2 space seperated intergers N and M.

Output Format:
Print single integer, i.e, number of distinct arrays G modulo 1000000007.
