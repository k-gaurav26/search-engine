Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N). A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.
You have to assign an integer to each node; for each valid i, let's denote the integer assigned to node i by Ai​. This assignment must satisfy the following conditions:

For each valid i, 1≤Ai​≤2⋅1018.
For each simple path in the tree, let's denote the set of nodes in this path by S. Then, the product P=∏v∈S​Av​ is divisible by ∣S∣.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
If there any multiple solutions, you may find any one of them. It can be proved a solution always exists under the given constraints.
