Problem
A number X is called bad if its binary representation contains odd number of 1 bits. For example, X=13=(1101)2​ is bad while X=3=(11)2​ is not bad.
Chef calls an array A of length N special if the following conditions hold:

For each 1≤i≤N, 0≤Ai​<220
All the elements of A are distinct
There does not exist any non-empty subset of A such that the bitwise XOR of the subset is bad.

For example,

A=[2,3,4] is not special because the XOR of the subset [2,3] is 2⊕3=1, which is bad. (⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation)
A=[3,3] is not special because its elements are not distinct.
A=[3,5] is special because it satisfies all the conditions.

Chef challenges you to construct any special array of length N. Can you complete Chef's challenge?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N — the length of the special array to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the special array of length N you constructed.
Note: It can be proved that a special array of length N always exists under the given constraints.
