"Everything in the universe is balanced. Every disappointment you face in life will be balanced by something good for you! Keep going, never give up."
Let's call a string balanced if all characters that occur in this string occur in it the same number of times.
You are given a string S; this string may only contain uppercase English letters. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose one letter in S and replace it by another uppercase English letter. Note that even if the replaced letter occurs in S multiple times, only the chosen occurrence of this letter is replaced.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert the given string to a balanced string.
Input

The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.

Output
