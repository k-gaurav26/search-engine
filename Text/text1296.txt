Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given all Nâˆ’1 integers in the range [2,N]. In each step, you choose 2 distinct integers and if they share a common factor greater than 1, you combine them into the same group. You keep doing it until no further merging is possible.
Belonging to a group is an equivalence relation. So if integers a and b are in the same group and integers b and c are in the same group, then integers a and c are also said to be in the same group.
Find the total number of groups formed in the end.
Input

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.
