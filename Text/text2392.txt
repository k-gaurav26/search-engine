Problem
There are N cities number from 1 to N each city is having a weight of wi​ and they are connected through M bidirectional roads between them.
Let the parity of a city ci​ be even if the number of set bits in its binary representation of wi​ is even and odd otherwise.
You are given Q queries, each query can be of two types:

1 K - print the size of largest connected group of cities in which parity of each city is odd after XOR with K.
2 K -  print the size of largest connected group of cities in which parity of each city is even after XOR with K.

A group of cities is said to be connected if we can go from one city of the group to any other city of the group without passing through any city that is not in the group. A group with one city is considered as connected.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line input of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting wi​.
The next M lines contain two space-separated integers Ui​ and Vi​, each denoting a bidirectional edge between the cities Ui​ and Vi​.
The next Q lines describe each query in the format given above.

Output:

For each query of type 1 -  print the size of largest connected group of cities in which parity of each city is odd after XOR with K.
For each query of type 2-  print the size of largest connected group of cities in which parity of each city is even after XOR with K.
