Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Given an array A consisting of N positive integers, and Q queries on it. The queries can be of five types: 

1 l r - let S - sorted set of elements with indices between l and r. You need to find: 

2 x y - assign the value y to element at position x. 
3 x - delete element at position x from array. 
4 z y - insert y after element at position z. If z equal 0 then y should insert before the first element. 
5 l r - count the number of distinct numbers in array between indices l and r. 


All the indices in the queries are 1-based.
Array always contains at least one element.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers N and Q denoting the number of elements in A, and the number of queries to be executed. The second line of input contains N integers denoting the array A. Each of the next Q lines contains one query.
Output
For each query of type 1 or type 5, output the answer to the query in a single line.
