Problem

The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv has an array A that consists of N positive integers. Let A[i] be the i-th number in this array (i = 1, 2, ..., N).

Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A. More formally, this x should satisfy the following relations:


A[1] mod x = 0, A[2] mod x = 0, ..., A[N] mod x = 0,


where mod stands for the modulo operation. For example,  8 mod 3 = 2,  2 mod 2 = 0, 100 mod 5 = 0 and so on. If such number does not exist, output -1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of the array A for the corresponding test case. The second line contains N space separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].

Output

For each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.
