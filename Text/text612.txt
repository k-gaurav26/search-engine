The Chef had a box with N numbers arranged inside it: A1, A2, ..., AN. He also had the number N at the front, so that he knows how many numbers are in it. That is, the box actually contains N+1 numbers. But in his excitement due the ongoing IOI, he started dancing with the box in his pocket, and the N+1 numbers got jumbled up. So now, he no longer knows which of the N+1 numbers is N, and which the actual numbers are.
He wants to find the largest of the N numbers. Help him find this.
