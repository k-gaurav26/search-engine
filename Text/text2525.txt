Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

Devus are creatures living in Devupur. There are total n Devus in Devupur. ith Devu live in ith house. Houses 1, 2, 3, , ,  n are placed in a single lane i.e. 1 is a neighbor of 2,  2 is a neighbor of 1 and 3 etc.


They decide their president by a very weird voting system. All the Devus contest in the presidential elections. Each person uniformly randomly votes any of the n person as his preference (he can vote himself too). Devus are really very envious creatures, so no Devu casts his vote to the person whom his neighbor has casted. Devus vote in the increasing order of their IDs.


Finally all the votes are counted and all the Devus having votes equal to highest voted Devu are selected as president.


Now you are interested in finding out expected number of presidents Devupur can select in their upcoming election. Please round the answer to 6 digits after decimal.
