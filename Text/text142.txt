Problem
A bulb company claims that the average lifetime of its bulbs is at least X units.
The company ran a test on N bulbs. You are given the lifetime of N−1 of these bulbs. What is the minimum non-negative integer value of lifetime the remaining bulb can have, such that the claim of the company holds true?
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and X - denoting the number of test bulbs and the minimum average lifetime of bulbs in the company's claim.
The second line of each test case contains N−1 space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN−1​ denoting the lifetimes of N−1 of the test bulbs.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the minimum non-negative integer value of lifetime the remaining bulb can have such that the claim of the company holds true.
