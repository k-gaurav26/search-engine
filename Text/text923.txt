Limak is a little polar bear.
He is playing a video game and he needs your help.
There is a row with N cells, each either empty or occupied by a soldier, denoted by '0' and '1' respectively.
The goal of the game is to move all soldiers to the right (they should occupy some number of rightmost cells).
The only possible command is choosing a soldier and telling him to move to the right as far as possible.
Choosing a soldier takes 1 second, and a soldier moves with the speed of a cell per second.
The soldier stops immediately if he is in the last cell of the row or the next cell is already occupied.
Limak isn't allowed to choose a soldier that can't move at all (the chosen soldier must move at least one cell to the right).
Limak enjoys this game very much and wants to play as long as possible.
In particular, he doesn't start a new command while the previously chosen soldier moves.
Can you tell him, how many seconds he can play at most?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a string S describing the row with N cells.
Each character is either '0' or '1', denoting an empty cell or a cell with a soldier respectively.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum possible number of seconds Limak will play the game.
