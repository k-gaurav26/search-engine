Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.

Sereja has a rooted tree of N nodes with node 1 being the root node. He wants to find the number of ways of assigning an integer in the range [1, M] to each node, such that value of each node should be a multiple of it's parent node's value (for vertex #1 there is no parent so any number fit condition). As the answer could be large, report it modulo (109 + 7).

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T — the number of test cases. T tests follow.
First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers (u, v) — a pair of vertices connected by an edge. 

Output
For each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the answer in separate line.
