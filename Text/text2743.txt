Problem
Read problem statements in Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Russian as well.
You are given a positive integer K and an array A consisting of N non-negative integers. Find the lexicographically smallest sequence B that satisfies the following conditions

We can obtain B by rearranging the elements in A.
The length of longest non-decreasing subsequence of B is equal to K.

If no such sequence exists, print −1.
Input Format

First line of the input contains T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers describing the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output the array B in a single line with a space between two consecutive elements. And output −1 if no such array B exists.
