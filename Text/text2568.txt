In Chefland, each citizen has their own personal string. Chef is no exception. Recently, his string broke and he went to a shop to get a new one.
There are two strings in the shop: A and B. Chef may choose any substring As​ of A (possibly empty) and any substring Bs​ of B (also possibly empty). Then, the shop assistant cuts these substrings out and sells a single string C=As​+Bs​ (here, + denotes string concatenation) to Chef. For example, if A is "aba" and B is "cde", then some of the strings Chef can buy are "ba", "bac", "bacd", "ae", "d", "acde", "aba", "cde" or "abacde".
Chef has seen a lot of strings in his life and he liked exactly N of them (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th of these strings is denoted by Si​ and according to Chef, it has a beauty bi​. Let's denote the number of substrings of C that are equal to Si​ by cnti​(C). If Chef buys a string C, he says that the pleasure he gets from this string is ∑i=1N​cnti​(C)⋅bi​.
What is the maximum possible pleasure Chef can get from a string he buys in the shop?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string A.
The second line contains a single string B.
The third line contains a single integer N.
The following N lines describe Chef's favourite strings. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string Si​, followed by a space and an integer bi​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum pleasure.
