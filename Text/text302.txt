Problem
We have found a new chess character — pook. It has the qualities of both a rook and a pawn. Specifically, treating the chessboard to be an N×N grid where (i,j) denotes the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, a pook placed at square (x,y) threatens the following squares:

(i,y) for every 1≤i≤N
(x,i) for every 1≤i≤N
(x+1,y−1), if x<N and y≥2
(x+1,y+1), if x<N and y<N

Find the maximum number of pooks that can be placed on an empty N×N chessboard such that none of them threaten each other.
Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing a single integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the maximum number of pooks that can be placed on the chessboard such that they don't threaten each other.
