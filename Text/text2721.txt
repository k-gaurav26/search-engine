Chef has a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. The sequence is circular, i.e. for each valid i, elements Ai​ and Ai+1​ are considered adjacent, and elements A1​ and AN​ are also considered adjacent. Initially, each element of this sequence is either 1 or 0.
You may perform some operations on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose an index i such that Ai​=1 and move that 1 to one of its adjacent elements, i.e. change Ai​ to 0, choose one of the elements adjacent to Ai​ and increment it by 1.
According to Chef, a sequence is good if all its elements are different from 1. You have to tell Chef the minimum number of operations needed to turn the sequence A into a good sequence or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of required operations, or −1 if it is impossible to make the sequence good.
