You are given a rooted tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N); node 1 is the root. For each valid i, the i-th node has a value vi​ and another parameter mi​.
A leaf is a node without sons. Let's denote the number of leaf nodes in the tree by L and their numbers by l1​,l2​,…,lL​, in increasing order. Then, for each valid i, let's define the answer for the leaf li​ in the following way:

Consider the path from the root to li​. For each node on this path (including the root and this leaf), choose a non-negative integer and multiply the value of this node by it.
Sum up the resulting values of all nodes on this path.
The answer ai​ for this leaf is defined as the maximum possible remainder of this sum modulo mli​​.

Find the answers for all leaves.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting that nodes x and y are connected by an edge.
The next line contains N space-separated integers v1​,v2​,…,vN​.
The last line contains N space-separated integers m1​,m2​,…,mN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing L space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aL​.
