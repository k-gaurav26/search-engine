Chef is given an array A consisting of N positive integers. Chef shuffles the array A and creates a new array B of length N, where Bi​=(Ai​+i)mod2, for each i(1≤i≤N).
Find the maximum possible sum of integers of the array B, if Chef shuffles the array A optimally.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum sum of integers of the array B.
