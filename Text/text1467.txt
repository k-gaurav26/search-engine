Chef likes solving problems involving a lot of queries with numbers. One day, he found a new problem which he finds difficult to solve. Therefore, he's asking for your help!
You are given a sequence A1, A2, ..., AN and Q queries. There are two types of queries:

1 X Y — Set AX = Y.
2 L R G — Compute the number of indices i such that L ≤ i ≤ R and gcd(G, Ai) = 1.


Find the answer to each query of the second type.
Note: gcd(X, Y) denotes the greatest common divisor — the highest positive integer which divides both X and Y.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the sequence.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.
The third line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the following Q lines describes one query in the following format:

1 X Y for a query of the first type
2 L R G for a query of the second type



Output
For each query of type 2, print a single line containing one integer - the answer to the query.
