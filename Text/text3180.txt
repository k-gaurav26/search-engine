Problem
Ashi had been given an array A having N element and you are asked Q queries of 3 types.
1 X :- If the array element at index X is even, then move it to the beginning of the array, otherwise move it to the end of the array (if the element is moved to the beginning then all numbers behind the index X will be shifted one position right to their initial positions and if it is moved to the end then all elements after the index X will move one position left to their initial positions.)
For example, if the array is A=[1,2,3,4,5] and after moving of 4th element to the beginning, the changed array will be A=[4,1,2,3,5].
2 X P :- Change element of the array at index X to P
3 L R K :- Find the count of numbers of the array A from index L to R (including both L and R) having K set bits.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q, the number of elements in the array A, and the number of queries.
The second line contains N space-separated integers of the array A.
Next Q lines contain two, there, or four space-separated integers according to the type of query, the first integer will represent the type of query.

Output

For each query of type 3 print the required number in a new line.
