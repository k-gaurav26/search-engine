Problem
Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a set S and Q queries. Initially, S is empty. In each query:

You are given a positive integer X.
You should insert X into S.
For each y∈S before this query such that y=X, you should also insert y⊕X into S (⊕ denotes the XOR operation).
Then, you should find two values E and O: the number of elements of S with an even number of 1-s and with an odd number of 1-s in the binary representation, respectively.

Note that a set cannot have duplicate elements, so if you try to insert into S an element that is already present in S, then nothing happens.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer Q.
Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer X describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers E and O.
