Problem
 
 Abhijeet just got his heart broken recently and thus he  decided to make a hard problem this time. 
The problem is stated below :  A tree containing N nodes and rooted at node 1 is given. On each node of the tree, there is a monkey having information about a graph G.

G is a graph containing N nodes.
The information contained on each node is an edge of the graph G .

Now for every node X, consider the path from root to X. You have to collect the information about edges from this path and construct a new graph G'.
The constructed graph G' will be a sub-graph of graph G obviously.

For each node you need to find the number of connected component in graph G'.

 
Input
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in tree and the graph G . 

The next N-1 lines contains two space separated integers,U and V which  means there is a bidirectional edge between node U and node V in the tree.   

The next N lines contains two space separated integers,U and V which is information contained by the node from 1 to N .


Output

For each node starting from 1 to N, print the required answer for each node in a new line .
