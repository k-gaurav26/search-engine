Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You are given an array of N integers a1, a2, ..., aN and an integer K. Find the number of such unordered pairs {i, j} that 
i ≠ j
|ai + aj - K| is minimal possible
Output  the minimal possible value of |ai + aj - K| (where i ≠ j) and the number of such pairs for the given array and the integer K.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers - N and K respectively.
The second line contains N single space separated integers - a1, a2, ..., aN respectively.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing two single space separated integers - the minimal possible value of |ai + aj - K| and the number of unordered pairs {i, j} for which this minimal difference is reached.
