Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Chef was invited to the party of N people numbered from 1 to N. Chef knows the growth of all the people, i.e. he knows the growth of the ith person is denoted by an integer Ai not exceeding M.
Chef decided to have some fun. At first, he forms K groups of people. The ith group consists of all the people numbered from Li to Ri. Groups may overlap too. 


For each group, Chef wants to know the following information: the maximum difference between the numberings of two people having same growth.  Formally, Chef wants to know the following:max{|x − y| : Li ≤ x, y ≤ Ri and Ax = Ay}
Please help Chef to have fun.
Input
There is only one test case in one test file.
The first line of input contains three space-separated integers N, M and K, denoting the number of people, the maximum growth and number of groups respectively. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the growth of people. Then the ith line of the next K lines contains two space-separated integers Li, Ri, denoting the ith group.
Output
For each group, output the integer denoting the maximum difference between numbering of two people having same growth in a single line.
