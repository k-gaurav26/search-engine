Problem
For an integer K and a permutation A=[A1​,A2​,…,AN​] of values from 1 to N, we define a function f(A) that returns the number of pairs of integers (i,j) such that

1≤i<j≤N
j>i+K
Aj​>Ai​
For all x≥(i+1) and x≤(j−1) , Ax​<Ai​
for all x<i , Ax​<Ai​

In simple words, in the subarray A[1..j]​, Ai​ is the second-largest element and Aj​ is the
largest element.
You are given K. Calculate ∑f(A) for ALL permutations A of size N.
Since the answer can be very large, find the sum over modulo 109+7.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the sum of f(P) for
all permutation of size N for the given K.
