Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Sereja has an array consisting of n integers a1​ ≤a2​ ≤…≤an​. Based on this array, he has to answer m queries represented by pairs integers t and d.
The answer for a query is the smallest integer i for which there exist some k (i ≤ k) such that ai​ + d ≥ ai + 1​, ai + 1​ + d ≥ ai + 2​, …, ak − 1​ + d≥ ak​, ak​ ≤ t and ak+1​ > t (if it exists).
Help Sereja find the answer for each query.
Input

First line of input contains a single integer n
Next line contain n space separated integers a1​, a2​, ..., an​.
Next line contains a single integer m.
Next m lines contain pairs of integers representing the queries.

Output

For each query, output the answer on a separate line.
