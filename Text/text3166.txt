Chef has a set of integers A1, A2, ..., AN. Define the Chef's number for the set as a minimal sum of penalties of the connections between numbers from this set(each number must be connected with at least one other number), if size of the set more or equal than 2, and 0 otherwise. The connection between numbers x and y has a penalty equal the absolute value |x-y|. Chef can add elements in the set and remove elements from it, after every such operation he wants to know the Chef's number for his set. Please help him to solve this complicated task.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two positive integers N denoting the number of elements in the set and Q denoting the number of operations performed by Chef. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the set A, all numbers in A are pairwise distinct. Next Q lines contains two integers - type and x. type = 1 x denoting that Chef adding the number x in the set, it's guaranteed that x not in the set. type = 2 x denoting that Chef erases element x from it, it's guaranteed that x exists there.
 
Output
After every add/erase operation of Chef output a Chef's number for the set A.
