Problem
A permutation of length N is an array of N integers P=[P1​,P2​,…,PN​] such that every integer from 1 to N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. For example, [2,3,4,1] is a permutation of length 4.
A subsegment of an array A[L…R]=[AL​,AL+1​,…,AR​] is called good if the subsegment is a permutation of length (R−L+1). For example, the array A=[2,3,1,4,2] contains 3 good subsegments: A[3…3]=[1], A[1…3] =[2,3,1], A[2…5]=[3,1,4,2].
You are given two integers N and K. Find a permutation of length N such that it contains exactly K good subsegments. Print -1 if no such permutation exists.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer:

If no permutation satisfies the given conditions, print −1.
Otherwise, print N space-separated integers P1​,P2​,…,PN​, denoting the elements of the permutation. If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.
