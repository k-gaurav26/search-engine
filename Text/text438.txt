Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given a string S with length N. Determine if it is possible to find two non-empty strings A and B which satisfy the following conditions:

A+B=S, where + denotes string concatenation
B is a substring of A

Note: B is a substring of A if B can be obtained from A by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end. For example, "ab" is a substring of "cabd", but "ad" is not.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains a single string S.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find strings A and B satisfying the given conditions or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
