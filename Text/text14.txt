To maintain peace, Batman can do the following type of operation:

Choose indices i and j (1≤i≤j≤N) and reverse the substring A[i,j].

Determine the length of the longest range of friends after applying at most k operations on the string for all 0≤k≤N.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of houses in Gotham city.
The next line contains a string A with N characters. The ith character denotes the type of the ith person.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line, (N+1) space-separated integers where the ith integer signifies the length of the longest range of friends after applying  at most i operations.
