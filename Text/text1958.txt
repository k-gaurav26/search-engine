As part of his daily job, Chef has to solve problems involving sets. Till now, Chef has been using inefficient methods to solve his set related problem, wasting a lot of his precious time. He has agreed to pay you a lot of money for solving the following problem for him efficiently.


First, Chef needs to perform Q operations on a set. Each operation is either:

1. Add a number to the set (if this number is NOT already present in the set).
2. Erase a number from the set (if this number exists in the set).


Then, he needs to find the sum of all elements of the set after performing these Q queries. Your job is to find this sum for him quickly.

Input
The first line of input contains four integers — Q, S1, A, B. S1 is the first number in the operations. A and B are special constants explained later.

Every operation Si is represented by a single integer. If Si is odd, then it represents the first operation, otherwise the second type, and in both of them the integer you have to add/delete equals [Si / 2], where [] is the greatest integer (or floor) function.

Si = (A*Si-1 + B) mod 232 when i > 1.


Note: In this problem, the time limit is very tight. Using built-in data structures, such as set/unordered_set in C++ or TreeSet/HashSet in Java, may lead to a Time Limit Exceed verdict.

Output
Output a single line containing a single integer — sum of elements in the set after Q queries.
