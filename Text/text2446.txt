Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array A consisting of N positive integers. You have to answer Q queries on it of following type: 

l r k : Let S denote the sorted (in increasing order) set of elements of array A with its indices between l and r. Note that set S contains distinct elements (i.e. no duplicates).
You need to find kth number in it. If such a number does not exist, i.e. the S has less than k elements, output -1.


All the indices in the queries are 1-based.
Input
The first line of input contains two space separated integers N and Q denoting the number of elements in A, and the number of queries, respectively. 


	The second line of input contains N space separated integers denoting the array A. 


	Each of the next Q lines contains five integers ai, bi, ci, di, ki. 
	We will generate li, ri indices for this query as follows:

Let answer for i - 1th query equal ansi - 1. 
For 0th query ans0 = 0. 
Define li = (ai x max(ansi - 1, 0) + bi) mod N + 1, 
ri = (ci x max(ansi-1, 0) + di) mod N + 1. 
If li > ri, then swap li and ri.
	
Output
For each query, output the answer to the query in a single line. If such a number doesn't exist, output -1.
