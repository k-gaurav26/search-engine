Problem
Salmon is playing a game!
He is given two integers N and K. His goal is to output K pairs (xi​,yi​). He creates a function f such that f(xi​)=yi​ and f is undefined for all other values of x. His pairs must then meet the following conditions:

All xi​ are distinct.
All yi​ are distinct.
All xi​,yi​ are in the range [0,2N−1] and are integers.
f(f(xi​)) is defined for all i.
Let H(x) be the number of set bits in the binary representation of x. Then, H(xi​)=H(f(f(xi​))) for all i.

Unfortunately, Salmon is unable to solve this. Help Salmon win the game!
If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them. It can be proven that a solution exists for all N and K that meet constraints.
Input

The first line input contains a single integer T denoting the number of testcases
Each of the next T lines contains two space-separated integers N and K respectively.

Output

Output K lines for each testcase.
The i-th line of a testcase should contain two space-separated integers: xi​ and yi​, following the given constraints.
