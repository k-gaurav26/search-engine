 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.
Chef has a sequence A consisting of N integers each lying between 1 and K, both inclusive. Now he wants to construct another sequence B of the same length also containing integers between 1 and K (again, both inclusive). Find out in how many ways he can construct the sequence B, such that the length of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  of A and B is exactly L. As the answer could be large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Input
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines: 

The first line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, K, and L.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ... AN. 

Output
For each test case output the number of ways to construct B as described above. Output the result modulo 109 + 7.
