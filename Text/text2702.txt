Being a newcomer to Computopia, Chef is confused by the countless subway lines in the city. Help him!
You are given an undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. There are no self-loops and no simple cycles that contain more than 2 edges in the graph (i.e. if we replaced each set of multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices by one edge, we would obtain a tree). Each edge also has a colour.
Consider a simple path with length K in the graph that passes through edges with colours A1​,A2​,…,AK​ in this order. The cost of this path is defined as (A1​=A2​)+(A2​=A3​)+⋯+(AK−1​=AK​), where the boolean value true is interpreted as the integer 1 and false is interpreted as 0. In other words, the cost of a simple path is the number of pairs of neighbouring (consecutive) edges on this path with different colours. The cost of a path with length 0 is defined to be 0.
You need to answer Q queries. In each query, you are given vertices u and v; you should find the maximum possible cost of some simple path connecting them.
Note that a simple path may not visit a vertex more than once.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
Each of the next M lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting an edge between vertices u and v with colour w.
The next line contains an integer Q.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum cost of a simple path.
