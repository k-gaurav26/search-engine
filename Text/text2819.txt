Problem
You are given a N×M matrix A, filled with distinct numbers. You can start at any cell. If you are currently at cell (x1​,y1​), then you can jump to any other cell (x2​,y2​), if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied:


Ax2​,y2​​>Ax1​,y1​​


Manhattan distance between Ax2​,y2​​ and Ax1​,y1​​ >S. Formally, ∣x1​−x2​∣+∣y1​−y2​∣>S.


Let V be the set of the cells visited by you.
Maximize the value of ∑(x,y)∈V​ Ax,y​.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains the number T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N,M,S - the parameters defined in the statement.
Then N lines follow, with M integers in each line.
Each of the next N lines contains M integers, where the j-th integer in i-th line is equal to Ai,j​

Output Format
For each testcase output the maximum possible value of ∑(x,y)∈V​ Ax,y​.
