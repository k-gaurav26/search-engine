Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.
You are given a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N).
The distance d(p,q) between two nodes p and q of the tree is the number of edges on the unique path between them.
There will be Q events each of which can be of the following three types:


'1 u': A certain node u becomes a special node. It is guaranteed that u was not special before this event.


'2 u': A certain node u becomes no longer special. It is guaranteed that u was special before this event.


'3 K': You are given a non-negative integer K. For a node x, define f(x)=max{d(x,y):y is special}. You must answer if there exists a node x such that f(x)=K. In other words, you are asked whether there exists a node x whose distance to the farthest special node is K. Note that x doesn't have to be special. It is guaranteed that there is at least one special node in the tree at the time of this event.


In the beginning, there are no special nodes.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N−1 lines follow. The i-th of these lines contains two integers ui​ and vi​ denoting an edge of the tree.
The next line contains a single integer Q - the number of events.
Q lines follow. The i-th of these lines contains two integers ti​ (the type of the i-th query) and qi​. If ti​=1 or ti​=2, qi​ is the vertex whose status is being changed. If ti​=3, qi​ is the parameter describing a query of the third type.

Output Format

For each test case, print a single line.
In that line, print l characters with no spaces between them, where l is the number of queries of third type in this test case.
For each valid i, the i-th character in the line should be 1 if there exists a node satisfying the conditions of the i-th query of third type in that test case and 0 otherwise.
