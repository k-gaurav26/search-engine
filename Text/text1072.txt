In order clean his lab, he has to achieve cleaning level of lab as Y. The current cleaning level of the lab is X.
He must choose one positive odd integer a and one positive even integer b. Note that, he cannot change a or b once he starts cleaning.
He can perform any one of the following operations for one round of cleaning:
1. Replace X with X+a.
2. Replace X with X−b.
Find minimum number of rounds (possibly zero) to make lab clean.
