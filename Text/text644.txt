Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

Today is chef's friend's birthday. He wants to give a gift to his friend. So he was desperately searching for some gift here and there. 


Fortunately, he found an array a of size n lying around. The array contains positive integers. Chef's friend likes even numbers very much. So for the gift, chef will choose a  consecutive non-empty segment of the array. The segment should contain exactly k even integers. Though it can have any number of odd integers.
He will then pick that segment and gift it to his friend. 


But there is a problem. It might not be always possible for the chef to choose such a segment. Please tell whether it is possible for chef to select some gift or not?

Input

First line of the input contains a single integer  T  denoting number of test cases. 
For each test case, first line contains two space separated integers n, k. 
Next line contains n space separated integers denoting content of array a. 
It is also guaranteed that all the numbers in the array a are distinct. 

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the situation.
