Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
Chef's fans want to celebrate the special occasion of his birthday, so they are writing letters to him. Chef has received N such letters from N fans (numbered 1 through N). Initially, for each valid i, he assigned a beauty Bi​ to the letter from the i-th fan (these values may even be negative, for letters that are not written well).
Now, Chef wants you to process Q queries on these letters. There are two types of queries:

Q x y: Chef wants to choose integers l and r such that 1≤l≤x≤y≤r≤N and read all the letters from fans l,l+1,…,r. Find the maximum possible value of the sum of beauties of the letters he reads.
U x v: Chef reevaluates the beauty of the letter from the x-th fan. The new value of Bx​ becomes v.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.
Each of the next Q lines describes a query in the format described above.

Output
For each query of the first type, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum sum of beauties.
