You are given a string s consisting of upper case Latin alphabets, i.e. from 'A' to 'Z'. Your task is to find how many strings t with length equal to that of S, also consisting of upper case Latin alphabet are there satisfying the following conditions:

String t is lexicographical larger than s
When you write both s and t in the reverse order, t is still lexicographical larger than s.



Find out number of such strings t. As the answer could be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7

Input

The only line of input contains string s.

Output

Output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the result in modulo 109 + 7.
