However, fortunately, he now realises the gravity of the situation and decides to prepare as much as possible in the time remaining and try to score maximum marks possible using his analytical skills.
There are N chapters and only K minutes are left before the exam. Chapter i will be worth Mi​ marks in the exam, and shall take Ti​ minutes to study. Chef can study the chapters in any order but needs to study them completely and at most once. He knows that he will forget the first chapter that he will prepare (due to lack of sleep) and won’t be able to score any marks in it. Find the maximum marks that Chef can score in the exam.
Note that he cannot re-study the chapter that he has forgotten.
