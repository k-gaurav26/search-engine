Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Tuzik and his master Vanka are playing some unusual game. Initially there are two stacks of nuts. The first stack contains A nuts and the second contains B nuts. A player's move consists of two steps:

Choose one stack and eat it. 
Split the other stack into two new stacks. If a player can't split it he loses (if stack contains only 1 nut).


Tuzik starts the game. Tell who wins if both players play optimally.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The following T lines each contain 2 space-separated integers - A and B - for this test case.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the word "Tuzik" or "Vanka" (without quotes) depending on the winner in this test case.
