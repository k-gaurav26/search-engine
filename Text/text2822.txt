Problem
Consider a permutation P of length N. We call a subarray of P good if it contains the value X.
Consider a set S containing maximum elements of all good subarrays of P.
Permutation P is called beautiful if S contains exactly K distinct values.
Given three integers N, X, and K, you need to find the number of beautiful permutations of length N. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 998244353.
Note: A subarray is obtained from an array by removing some elements (possibly none) from the beginning and some elements (possibly none) from the end of the array.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, X, and K - the length of the permutation, the pivot value X, and the number of different values the maximum element of the focused subarrays can take on.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of beautiful permutations modulo 998244353.
