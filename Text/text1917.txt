Chef has a tree G with N nodes (numbered 1 through N) and N−1 undirected edges. For each node u in the tree, he can assign directions to the edges in such a way that u is reachable from all the other nodes. Let Cu​ be the number of valid topological orderings in the resulting directed acyclic graph.
This way, Chef obtains N pairs (C1​,1),(C2​,2),…,(CN​,N) and he sorts all these pairs (Ci​,i) in descending order (first by Ci​ and in the case of a tie by i).
For example, consider the tree below:

The sorted list of pairs is ((2,2),(1,3),(1,1)).
Chef quizzes you on this list ― he wants you to find the K-th pair in the sorted list. To make that task easier, Chef only asks for K=1 (the largest pair) or K=2 (the second largest pair). Since the number of topological orderings can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v, denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers u and Cu​ modulo 109+7, where (Cu​,u) is the K-th pair in the sorted list.
