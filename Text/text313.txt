Problem
Initially, Chef is at coordinate 0 on X-axis. For each i=1,2,â€¦,N in order, Chef does the following:

If Chef is at a non-negative coordinate, he moves i steps backward (i.e, his position's coordinate decreases by i), otherwise he moves i steps forward (i.e, his position's coordinate increases by i).

You are given the integer N. Find the final position of Chef on the X-axis after N operations.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the final position of Chef on the X-axis after N operations.
