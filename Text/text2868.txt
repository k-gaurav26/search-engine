Problem
You are given an array A consisting of N integers. Calculate the number of ways to divide this array into subsegments, such that the sequence formed by taking bitwise AND in each segment of the partition is a palindrome.
More formally, consider a partition of the array into segments [L1​,R1​], [L2​,R2​], [L3​,R3​], …, [Lk​,Rk​] such that L1​=1,L2​=R1​+1,L3​=R2​+1,…,Lk​=Rk−1​+1,Rk​=N. Let's define Bi​ as AND on i-th segment: Bi​=ALi​​∧…∧ARi​​, where x1​∧x2​∧…∧xt​, denotes bitwise AND of numbers x1​,…,xt​.
A partition is palindromic if Bi​=Bk+1−i​ for every 1≤i≤k. Your task is to calculate the number of palindromic partitions. Since this number can be large, calculate it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line of input contains T — the number of test cases you need to solve.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N — the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,…,AN​ — the elements of the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of ways to partition A into subsegments, such that the bitwise AND of these segments form a palindrome.
