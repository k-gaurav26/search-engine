Problem
Given an array A of length N, you have to perform Q queries on it.
There are three different type of queries:

1 L R - For every i such that L≤i≤R and Ai​>0, replace Ai​ with Ai​ ∣ (Ai​−1).
2 L R - For every i such that L≤i≤R and Ai​>0, replace Ai​ with Ai​ &amp; (Ai​−1).
3 x - Print Ax​.

Output the answer to each query of type 3.
Input Format

The first line contains 2 integers, N and Q - the number of elements in the array A and the number of queries, respectively.
The next line contains N integers - A1​, A2​, …, AN​, the elements of the array A.
i-th line of the next Q lines contains the description of the i-th query.

Output Format
For each query of type 3, output the value of Ax​.
