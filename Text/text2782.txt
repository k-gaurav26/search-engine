For positive integers a and b, we say that a fraction ba​ is good if it is equal to m+1m​ for some positive integer m.
You are given an integer N. Find the number of pairs of integers i,j such that 1≤i,j≤N and the fraction i+1i​⋅jj+1​ is good.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer N.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of pairs of integers i,j (1≤i,j≤N) such that i+1i​⋅jj+1​ is good.
