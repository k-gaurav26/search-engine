Once upon a time, in a land far, far away... nevermind, we don't recall the rest of the story.
All we know is that Chef has a matrix of integers M with N rows and N columns; he wants to take a single element from each row and a single element from each column (N elements in total) and find their bitwise XOR. Find the set of all values he could obtain.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of the following lines contains N space-separated integers Mi,1​,Mi,2​,…,Mi,N​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one or more space-separated integers in increasing order — the obtainable values.
