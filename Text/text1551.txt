Captain Dehatti from Bawanian village is making strategy to win the Fake Cricket World Cup organised in his village. 
He want his team to score runs only in 4's and 6's because he believes that scoring any runs by running will make them tired. 
He also wants that the team does not loose more than  L wickets.
