Problem
The manhattan distance between two points P1​(x1​,y1​) and P2​(x2​,y2​) is given by d(P1​,P2​)=∣x2​−x1​∣+∣y2​−y1​∣.
In other words, manhattan distance is the minimum number of moves required to reach P2​ from P1​ if, in each move, you are allowed to travel one unit along the X-axis or one unit along the Y-axis.
You are given an integer D. Find four points (P1​,P2​,P3​,P4​) with integer coordinates, such that:

The absolute value of both X and Y coordinates of all points is at most 109.
The manhattan distance between any pair of points is D .
More formally, d(Pi​,Pj​)=D for all 1≤i<j≤4.

If such set of points do not exist, print -1. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.
Note: It is guaranteed that whenever there exists a solution, there exists one in which all points have coordinates with absolute values not more than 109.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, D - as per the problem statement.

Output Format

If there is no solution, print in a single line the integer -1.
Otherwise print 4 lines. The ith line, should contain two space separated integers, Xi​Yi​, the coordinates of the point Pi​, such that 0≤∣Xi​∣,∣Yi​∣≤109.
