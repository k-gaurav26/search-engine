Chef gave you a sequence of integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​ and 3 integers K, m and x. Let's define the following functions:
G(i1​,…,iK​)=gcd(ai1​​,…,aiK​​)
Sx​(i1​,…,iK​)=ai1​x​+ai2​x​+…+aiK​x​
Pm​(i1​,…,iK​)=(ai1​​⋅ai2​​⋅…⋅aiK​​)m
W(T)=smallestprimedivisorofP1​(T)
Chef wants you to compute the sum of G(T)⋅W(T)⋅Sx​(T)⋅Pm​(T) over all K-tuples of indices T=(i1​,i2​,…,iK​) such that ij​∈{1,2,…,N} for each valid j (there are NK of these K-tuples). Since this sum could be enormous, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers N, K, m and x.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ∑T​G(T)⋅W(T)⋅Sx​(T)⋅Pm​(T) modulo 109+7.
