Problem

Chef Ciel got enormous cooking power from the Evil Book.
Instead, Ciel must devote 666 magical power to the Evil Book.


Other than Ciel, there are N chefs in the world.
The i-th chef has Ci cooking power and Mi magical power.
Ciel may get Mi magical power by defeating the i-th chef in a cooking battle, which needs Ci effort.
After that, the i-th chef's magical power Mi becomes 0.


The Evil Book can help her, if she gives X magical power to the Evil Book.
That is, by consuming X magical power, she can choose some i and multiply by 1/3 both the i-th chef's cooking power Ci and his magical power Mi.
Note that she can't take the help of the Evil Book unless she has at least X magical power.


Firstly, Ciel has no magical power.
What's the minimum total effort for collecting at least 666 magical power?

Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow.
Each test case contains N+1 lines.
The first line for each test case has 2 integers N and X.
The (i+1)-th line for each test case has 2 integers Ci and Mi.

Output

For each test case, print the minimum total effort (rounded to the nearest integer) for collecting at least 666 magical power.
If it is impossible to collect 666 magical power, print "impossible" without quotes.
