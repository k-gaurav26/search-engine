N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ are placed in a circle in such a way that for each valid i, Ai​ and Ai+1​ are adjacent, and A1​ and AN​ are also adjacent.
We want to repeat the following operation exactly N−1 times (until only one number remains):

Select two adjacent numbers. Let's denote them by a and b.
Score a+b penalty points.
Erase both a and b from the circle and insert a+b in the space between them.

What is the minimum number of penalty points we can score?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of penalty points.
