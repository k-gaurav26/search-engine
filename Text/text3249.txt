Akash has just learned the maximum subarray sum problem. And while thinking about the solution, he came up with a new problem, the maximum frequent subarray sum problem.
In this problem, you will be given an array A of N integers. You have to choose a non-empty subarray with the maximum possible score. The score of a subarray is calculated as
score(l,r)=(Al​+⋯+Ar​)⋅(occurrences)
Here, occurrences is the number of occurrences of that subarray in A.
Now Akash can't solve this problem, so please help him solve it.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n, the size of the array.
The second line contains n integers A1​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum possible score in a new line.
