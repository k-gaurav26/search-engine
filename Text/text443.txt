Problem
You are given an array A of length N containing the elements −1 and 1 only. Determine if it is possible to rearrange the array A in such a way that Ai​ is not the geometric mean of Ai−1​ and Ai+1​, for all i such that 2≤i≤N−1.
Y is said to be the geometric mean of X and Z if Y2=X⋅Z.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output Yes if it is possible to rearrange A in such a way that Ai​ is not the geometric mean of Ai−1​ and Ai+1​, where 2≤i≤N−1. Otherwise output No.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).
