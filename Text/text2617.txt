Problem
You have been given a string S of size N which consists of uppercase characters only. A  K-Magical String is a string in which the longest non - decreasing subsequence is of size exactly K.
You have been given Q queries where each query is in the form L,R, and K.
For each query, check whether substring from index L to index R can be converted into a K-Magical String or not by rearranging its characters and print the final rearranged string too.
If there exist multiple answers, print the lexicographically largest string possible.
Note:

Each query will be treated independently i.e. after each query the string will remain the same as it was initially.
The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.

Input Format

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the string.
The second line of each test case contains the string S given in question.
The third line of the test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Next, Q lines contain three space-separated integers L,R, and K.

Output Format
For each query in each test case, print "Yes" if it is possible to rearrange the characters of that substring such that it can be converted into K-Magical string and print the rearranged string else print "No" without quotes.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
