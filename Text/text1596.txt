Problem
You are given an array A of size N and an integer X.
Find the count of all the pairs (i,j) such that ((Ai​⊕Aj​) &amp; X)=0. Here ⊕ and &amp; denote bitwise XOR and bitwise AND operations respectively.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the size of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ - the elements of the array.
The third line of each test case contains a single integer X.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the total number of pairs satisfying the condition.
