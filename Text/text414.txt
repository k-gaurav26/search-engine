Chef Ada is preparing N dishes (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, it takes Ci​ minutes to prepare the i-th dish. The dishes can be prepared in any order.
Ada has a kitchen with two identical burners. For each valid i, to prepare the i-th dish, she puts it on one of the burners and after Ci​ minutes, removes it from this burner; the dish may not be removed from the burner before those Ci​ minutes pass, because otherwise it cools down and gets spoiled.
