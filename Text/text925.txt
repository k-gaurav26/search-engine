Problem
You are given a string S, each of whose characters is either '0', '1', or '?'.
The badness of a binary string is defined to be the (absolute) difference between the number of 1s and the number of 0s present in it. For example, 001 has badness ∣1−2∣=1 and 11111 has badness ∣5−0∣=5.
Your task is to replace every '?' present in S with either '0' or '1', such that the badness of the resulting binary string is minimized.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of characters of the string S.
The second line of each test case contains the string S, whose characters are either '0', '1', or '?'.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the binary string you obtained by replacing each '?' with either '0' or '1' such that its badness is minimum.
If there are multiple possible strings that minimize badness, you may print any of them.
