Problem
Nayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random arrays as birthday presents, but this time she received random arrays as presents for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with the array, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her the following problem.
You are given 3 integers M, P and N.
For an array A, let f(A) be defined as the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of A and let g(A)=(f(A))P.
Consider all distinct arrays A of length N such that 1≤Ai​≤M for all (1≤i≤N). Calculate the sum of g(A) over all such MN arrays. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 754974721.
Each test case has Q queries. For all Q queries, M and P remain the same, only N varies.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains three integers M,P, and Q.
Second line of each test case contains Q integers, values of N for each query.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line containing Q space-separated integers, answers for each query modulo 754974721.
