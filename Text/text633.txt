Problem
Chef has an array A of length N. He defines the alternating sum of the array as:

S=∣A1​∣−∣A2​∣+∣A3​∣−∣A4​∣+…(−1)N−1⋅∣AN​∣

Chef is allowed to perform the following operation on the array at most once:

Choose two indices i and j (1≤i<j≤N) and swap the elements Ai​ and Aj​.

Find the maximum alternating sum Chef can achieve by performing the operation at most once.
Note: ∣X∣ denotes the absolute value of X. For example, ∣−4∣=4 and ∣7∣=7.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains a single integer N - size of the array A.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers - denoting the elements of array A.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line, the maximum alternating sum Chef can obtain by performing the operation at most once.
