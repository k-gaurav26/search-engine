Problem
An array A of length N is said to be pseudo-sorted if it can be made non-decreasing after performing the following operation at most once.

Choose an i such that 1≤i≤N−1 and swap Ai​ and Ai+1​

Given an array A, determine if it is pseudo-sorted or not.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each testcase, output YES if the array A is pseudo-sorted, NO otherwise.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
