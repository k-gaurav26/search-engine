Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
N one dimensional kingdoms are represented as intervals of the form [ai , bi] on the real line.
A kingdom of the form [L, R] can be destroyed completely by placing a bomb at a point x on the real line if L 
≤ x ≤ R.


Your task is to determine minimum number of bombs required to destroy all the one dimensional kingdoms.
Input

First line of the input contains T denoting number of test cases.


For each test case, first line contains N denoting the number of one dimensional kingdoms.

For each next N lines, each line contains two space separated integers ai and bi.

Output
For each test case , output an integer denoting the minimum  number of bombs required.
