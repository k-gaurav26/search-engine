Problem
A bracket sequence is made up of brackets '(' and ')'. We define a balanced bracket sequence as following:

Empty sequence is balanced
If P is balanced, (P) is also balanced
If P and Q are balanced, PQ is also balanced

For example, empty sequence and sequences (())(), (), (()(())) are balanced. While (, )(, (() and (()))( are not balanced.
You are given a bracket sequence A of length N and Q queries of the following form:
L R : You are given two integers L and R (1≤L≤R≤N). Find the number of pairs (X,Y), where L≤X≤Y≤R, such that after removing the substring A[X,Y]​ from A[L,R]​,  the substring A[L,R]​ becomes a balanced bracket sequence.
In other words, for a given (L,R), find the number of pairs (X,Y), such that the sequence AL​…AX−1​AY+1​…AR​ is a balanced bracket sequence.
Note that, A[L,R]​ denotes the substring AL​AL+1​AL+2​…AR−1​AR​.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains 2 integers N and Q - the size of the bracket sequence and the number of queries.
The second line contains a string A of length N - the bracket sequence.
The next Q lines, each contain two integers Li​ and Ri​ - the queries to be answered.

Output Format
Print Q lines, representing the answer for each query.
