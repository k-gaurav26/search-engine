Rahul and Rashi are bored of playing the game of  Nim all day. More so, Rahul has been losing all the games. Actually, the array of stone piles for a game is always selected by Rashi from a huge N-length array A. This selected array is always a subarray of A.
Rahul, now frustrated by his losing streak, insists that he would play the next game only if she chooses a game array of length m. 
Can you find the number of such subarrays that Rashi can choose so that Rahul still loses? Moreover, since the value of m is decided by Rahul, can you do this for all possible values of m?
Please note that Rahul is always the first player.
Input:The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases to follow.
In each of the test cases, the first line contains a single integer N, and the next line contains N integers, representing the array A.
Output:
Output the results of each test case on a new line. For each test case, output the results for all values of m, that is, m = 1, m = 2 ... m = N, separated by a single space.
