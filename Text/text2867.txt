Problem
You're given a sequence of N - distinct positive integers, not necessarily sorted in ascending order. Your task is pretty straightforward: sort the sequence in ascending order. At any point of time, you can perform one of the following operations:


If there is only one sequence, with a length greater than 1, split it at some point to divide it into two non-empty sequences. The cost to perform this operation is the minimum of the sizes of the two broken parts.


If there are multiple sequences (due to one or more split operations in the past), you may choose one of them with a length greater than 1 and split it at some point to divide it into two non-empty sequences. The cost to perform this operation is the minimum of the sizes of the two broken parts.


If there are multiple sequences (due to one or more split operations in the past), you may choose two of them and concatenate them in any order. The cost to perform this operation is the length of the resulting sequence, i.e., the sum of the lengths of the first and the second part.


It turns out that there are a LOT of ways to sort the array by following this scheme! You need to find out the minimum cost of all the operations required to sort the array in the optimal manner.
Input Format

Each test file contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases, T. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, the elements of the array.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum cost of operations that is required to sort the array according to the given scheme.
