This is an interactive problem.
There are four hidden integers A,B,C,D (1≤A,B,C,D≤109). Your goal is to find out if A⋅B is greater, equal to or smaller than C⋅D.
To do that, you are allowed to ask up to Q queries. In each query:

You should choose integers a,b,c,d between −109 and 109 inclusive.
Let X=a⋅A+b⋅B+c⋅C+d⋅D.
You are told whether X>0, X=0 or X<0.

Note that the scoring for subtask 2 is linear. Please read the scoring function in the section Subtasks.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers T and Q. You should solve T test cases.
Output Format
For each test case:

First, you should ask up to Q queries.

To ask a query, print a line in the format "? a b c d" (without quotes), where a,b,c,d should be integers satisfying −109≤a,b,c,d≤109.
Then, you should read a single line containing one character '>', '=' or '<', denoting whether X \gt 0, X = 0 or X \lt 0.


Once you have found the answer, print a line containing the character '!' followed by a space and one of the characters '>', '=' or '<' denoting your answer (e.g. '>' denotes A⋅B>C⋅D).

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
