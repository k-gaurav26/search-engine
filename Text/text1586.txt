Problem
Cyborg Jenish is angry.
He has so much rage that he decided to go on a demolition spree for Q days.
There are N cities in his world numbered 1 to N, in a row from left to right. That is the ith city from left side is city-i where 1≤i≤N. The supreme leader of the world is VSM and there are infinite statues of VSM in each city.
On each day Jenish chooses two cities L and R. He starts at city-L and moves along the row towards right side till he reaches the city-R. In city-L he destroys 1 statue, in the next city (i.e. city-L+1) he destroys 2 statues, and so on till city-R where he destroys  R−L+1 statues. In other words, he destroys i−L+1 statues in the ith city ( L≤i≤R ).
Find the total number of VSM statues he destroyed in each city after Q days.
Input:

The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case, contains two space-separated integers N and Q denoting the number of cities in his world and  the number of days he goes on a demolition spree respectively.
The ith line of next Q lines of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R denoting the starting city and the ending city respectively on ith day.

Output:

For each test case, output a single line containing N space-separated integers.
The ith integer should denote the total number of VSM statues destroyed by cyborg Jenish in the city-i after Q days.
