Problem
There are N cans lying on the X-axis at points Xi​ (1≤i≤N). Each of the N cans is associated with two values Ai​ and Bi​.  Also, the segment between the points L and R (L≤R) is considered to be green zone including the points L and R.
There are two types of operations -
1. Select a can i out of the N cans and move it one unit in either direction along the axis, i.e. if before the operation can is at Xi​ then after the operation, it moves to either Xi​+1 or Xi​−1. This costs Bi​ coins and it can be performed any number of times for each of the cans.
2. Choose any integer k and shift the green zone to the segment between L′ and R′, where L′ and R′ are the mirror images of points R and L with respect to line X=k respectively. This operation should be performed exactly once.
After all the operations, you get number of coins equal to sum of values of Ai​ of the cans which lie in the final green zone.
We define the net coins as:
Number of coins you get - Number of coins spent
Find the maximum possible net coins you can earn.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each of the testcases consists of four lines.
First lines consists of three integers N, L and R.
Next line consist of N space separated integers X1​,X2​,...,XN​.
Next line consist of N space separated integers A1​,A2​,...,AN​.
Next line consist of N space separated integers B1​,B2​,...,BN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single integer, the maximum number of net coins you can earn.
