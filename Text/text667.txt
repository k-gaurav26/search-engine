Problem
Shefin gives you a string S and you have to find a non-empty string P such that:

P is a substring of S.
No non-empty substring of P is a prefix of S.
No non-empty substring of P is a suffix of S.

For all such possible strings, find the length of the longest string satisfying all the conditions. If no such string is possible, print −1.
A string A is a substring of a string B if A can be obtained from B by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end.
A prefix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the beginning of A. For example, "code" is a prefix of "codechef", but "ode" is not.
A suffix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the end of A. For example, "chef" is a suffix of "codechef", but "he" is not.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T - denoting number of test cases.
Each test case contains a string S consisting of lowercase english alphabets only.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer. If a string P exists based on the given conditions, print the maximum length of the possible string. Otherwise, print −1.
