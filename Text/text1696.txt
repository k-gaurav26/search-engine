Chef has defined a new type of rooted tree - divisor tree. In this tree, every node has a positive integer written on it. It follows some rules:
The root can have any positive integer written on it.
Suppose a node has the integer A written on it, and suppose A has k proper divisors. [Note: Proper divisors of an integer are all its divisors except the integer itself. 1 has no proper divisor] Then this node will have exactly k child nodes, and each of A's proper divisors will be written on exactly one of the child nodes. For example, a node with number 12 written on it would have children with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 written on them.

You can observe that the nodes have 1 written on them, if and only if, they are leaves. 
The score of a path in this tree is defined as the sum of degrees of all of the nodes in the path. The Score of the tree is defined as the maximum score of a path from the root to one of the leaves.
You are given two integers A, B. You want to find the sum of Scores of all the divisor trees which have n written on their root, where A ≤ n ≤ B.
Input
The only line of the input contains two space separated integers A and B respectively.
Output
Output a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.
