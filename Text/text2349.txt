Problem
In a country Stone Land, there are N stones arranged in a row from left to right. Each stone has some height represented by a positive number. The stones are numbered from 1 to N from left to right.
You are given an array H of size N consisting of the height of the N stones from left to
right.
Stone at jth position is visible from the stone at ith position if:-

j\gti
max(H[i],H[i+1],H[i+2],....,H[jâˆ’1]) < H[j]

You are asked M queries.

Each query consists of two different positions of stones A and B.
You have to Print the total number of stones that are visible from both the stones at the position A and B.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M, where N is the number of stones and M is the number of queries.
The Second line consists of N space-separated integers (array H) denoting the height of stones from left to the right separated by a space.
Next, M lines consist of two space-separated integers A and B separated by space where A and B are positions of stones.
