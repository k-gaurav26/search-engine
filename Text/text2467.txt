Problem
Given a sequence X of length M, f(X) is defined as f(X)=∑i=1M−1​∣Xi+1​−Xi​∣.
Specifically, if M=1, then f(X)=0.
For e.g., f([3,1,7,2])=∣1−3∣+∣7−1∣+∣2−7∣=13
JJ has an array A of length N. He wants to divide the array A into two subsequences P and Q (possibly empty) such that the value of f(P)+f(Q) is as large as possible. (Note that each Ai​ must belong to either subsequence P or subsequence Q).
Help him find this maximum value of f(P)+f(Q).
Note: A sequence X is a subsequence of a sequence Y if X can be obtained from Y by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ denoting the array A.

Output Format
Output the largest value of f(P)+f(Q).
