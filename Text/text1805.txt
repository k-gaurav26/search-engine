Problem
Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
Two strings A and B are equivalent (denoted by A∼B) if they have the same lengths and A can be transformed into B by performing the following operation zero or more times: choose a substring of A which contains '1' an even number of times and reverse this substring.
You are given a binary string S. Find the number of different equivalence classes of the substrings of this string. In other words, find the smallest possible size of a set C of binary strings with the following property: for each non-empty string R which is a substring of S (including S itself), there is a string X∈C such that R∼X.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S with length N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of equivalence classes among the substrings of the given string.
