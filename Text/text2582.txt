Problem
Suppose that you have several powers of two, specifically, you have Ai​ numbers equal to 2i for each 1≤i≤N. You want to divide all of these numbers into two groups with equal sum. However, it's not always possible.
To make it possible, in one operation you are allowed to choose any 1≤i≤N and receive an extra number 2i (in other words, you can increase any Ai​ by 1). Let's define f(A1​,A2​,…,AN​) as the smallest number of operations that you need to make to be able to split the numbers into two groups with equal sums.
You are given N integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​. Find the sum of f(A1​,A2​,…,AN​) over all tuples (A1​,A2​,…,AN​) with 0≤Ai​≤Bi​ (there are (B1​+1)(B2​+1)…(BN​+1) of them). As this number may be very large, output it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N − the number of integers.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer modulo 998244353 on a new line.
