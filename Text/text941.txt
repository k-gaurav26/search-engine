Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a string s with length n. You should find a permutation P of numbers 1 through n such that if you apply this permutation on the string s, you will get a palindromic string.
The result of applying a permutation P on the string s is a string t with length n such that for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the i-th character of t is given as as t[i] = s[Pi].
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains the string s.
Output
For each test case, print a single line. If it is impossible to find a valid permutation P, this line should contain a single integer -1. Otherwise, it should contain n space-separated integers P1, P2, ..., Pn.
If there are multiple valid permutations, you may print any one.
