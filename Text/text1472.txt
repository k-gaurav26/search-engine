Problem
You are given an integer N. Let K be a divisor of N of your choice such that K>1, and let M=KNâ€‹. You need to find the smallest K such that M has as many divisors as possible.
Note: U is a divisor of V if V is divisible by U.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line minimum value of K such that M has as many divisors as possible.
