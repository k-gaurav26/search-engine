Sereja asks you to find out number of arrays A of size N, i.e. A1, A2, ..., AN (1 ≤ Ai ≤ M), such that for each pair i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N) gcd(Ai, Aj) = 1.


As the answer could be large, print it modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007).

Input

First line of the input contain an integer T - number of test cases. 

T tests follow. First line of each test case contain two space separated integers N, M. 

Output

For each test case output required answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
