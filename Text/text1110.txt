Problem
You are given two strings S and A of lengths N and M respectively.

String S contains characters from the set {?, a, b, c, d, e}.
String A contains characters from the set {a, b, c, d, e}.

Let S′ denote the string formed by replacing all the ? in S using the characters from the set {a, b, c, d, e}.
Construct S′ such that A is not a subsequence of S′.
If multiple such S′ exist, output any. If no such S′ exists, print −1.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M - the lengths of strings S and A respectively.
The second line of each test case contains string S.
The third line of each test case contains string A.

Output Format
For each test case, output any valid string S′. If no such string exists, print −1.
