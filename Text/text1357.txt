Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Chef likes strings a lot but moreover he likes good strings. Chef calls a string str a good string if str starts and ends at different characters. For eg : strings such as abab , baccba , abc are all good strings whereas strings like aba, baab , baacaab are not good at all .
Today, Chef has a special string P consisting of lower case letters "c" , "h" , "e" and "f" only. Chef wants to make some queries about his string P.
Each of chef's query has the following form a b L R. For a given query, Chef wants to count the number of good strings which starts at letter a and ends at letter b such that starting index Si and ending index Ei of a chosen substring satisfies L <= Si < Ei <= R.
NOTE
Two substrings P1 and P2 are considered to be different if either S1 != S2 or E1 != E2 where S1,E1 and S2,E2 are the starting and ending index of string P1 and string P2 respectively.
Chef is not able to accomplish this task efficiently. Can you help him ?
Input
First line of the input contains a string P denoting the chef's special string. Next line of the input contains a single integer Q denoting the number of chef's queries. Next Q lines of the input contains four space separated parameters where the first two parameters are characters denoting a and b respectively and rest two are integers denoting L and R respectively.

Output
For each chef's query, print the required answer.
