Chef has an integer sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. For each index i (1≤i≤N), Chef needs to divide Ai​ into two positive integers x and y (ie. x,y>0) such that x+y=Ai​, then place this as a point (x,y) in the infinite 2-dimensional coordinate plane. Help Chef to find the maximum number of distinct points that can be put in the plane, if he optimally splits the values Ai​. Note that Chef can only perform one split for each index.
Note: Please use fast input/output methods for this problem.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of distinct points there can be in the infinite plane.
