Do you know Professor Saeed? He is the algorithms professor at Damascus University. Yesterday, he gave his students hard homework (he is known for being so evil) - for a given binary string S, they should compute the sum of F(S,L,R) over all pairs of integers (L,R) (1≤L≤R≤∣S∣), where the function F(S,L,R) is defined as follows:

Create a string U: first, set U=S, and for each i (L≤i≤R), flip the i-th character of U (change '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').
Then, F(S,L,R) is the number of valid pairs (i,i+1) such that Ui​=Ui+1​.

As usual, Professor Saeed will give more points to efficient solutions. Please help the students solve this homework.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ∑1≤L≤R≤∣S∣​F(S,L,R).
