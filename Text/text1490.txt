Problem
You are given two arrays A = A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and B = B1​,B2​,…,BN​. We want to make these two arrays identical. That is, for each 1≤i≤N, we want to make Ai​ = Bi​. To do this, we are allowed to make many operations of the following type:
In a single operation, we choose two integers x and y, and replace all the occurrences of x in both the arrays with y. This operation is denoted by (x,y). Notice that regardless of the number of characters replaced, it will still be counted as a single operation.
A sequence of operations ((x1​,y1​),(x2​,y2​),…,(xm​,ym​)) is said to be optimal, if after performing these operations in the given order, both arrays A and B are identical, and there is no sequence with fewer operations which can achieve the same.
You will also be given an integer K which will either be 1 or 2. If K=1, you need to output the minimum number of operations needed to make the two arrays identical. If K=2, in addition to the minimum number of operations, you should also output the number of different optimal sequences. As this number could be huge, output it modulo 109+7.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer, T, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers: N, and K.
The next line contains N integers: A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The next line contains N integers: B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output:

You need to output a single line for each testcase.
If K=1, then that corresponding line should contain a single integer, which is the minimum number of operations needed.
If K=2, then that corresponding line should contain two integers, the minimum number of operations needed and the number of optimal sequences modulo 109+7.
