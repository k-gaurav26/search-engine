There are N minions who are competing in an election of the president of the ACM (Association of Cute Minions). They are standing in a line in the order from minion 1 to minion N. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), the i-th minion has an influence level of Si.
A single minion may cast any number of votes. Minion j will vote for minion i (i ≠ j) if and only if the influence level of the j-th minion is greater than or equal to the sum of influence levels of all the minions standing between them (excluding the i-th and j-th minion).
Your task is to find the number of votes received by each minion.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of minions.
The second line contains N space-separated integers S1, S2, ..., SN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should denote the number of votes the i-th minion will get.
