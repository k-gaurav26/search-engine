You are given a sequence of non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. At most once, you may choose a non-negative integer X and for each valid i, change Ai​ to Ai​⊕X (⊕ denotes bitwise XOR).
Find the minimum possible value of the sum of all elements of the resulting sequence.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum possible sum.
