Problem
You are given an array A of length N.
You have to partition the elements of the array into some subsequences such that:

Each element Ai​ (1≤i≤N) belongs to exactly one subsequence.
The mean of the mean of subsequences is maximised.

Formally, let S1​,S2​,…,SK​ denote K subsequences of array A such that each element Ai​ (1≤i≤N) belongs to exactly one subsequence Sj​ (1≤j≤K).
Let Xj​ (1≤j≤K) denote the mean of the elements of subsequence Sj​. You need to maximise the value K∑j=1K​Xj​​.
Print the maximum value. The answer is considered correct if the relative error is less than 10−6.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case consists of a single integer N - denoting the length of array A.
Second line of each test case consists of N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ - denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the maximum possible mean of mean of subsequences. The answer is considered correct if the relative error is less than 10−6.
