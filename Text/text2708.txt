Problem
Consider an array A of length N. You know that for all 1≤i≤N, 0≤Ai​≤105. We construct an array B of length N−1 such that, for all 1≤i≤N−1, Bi​=min(Ai​,Ai+1​).
You are given the array B, you need to find out the total number of distinct arrays A which we could have used to construct the given array B.
The answer may be large, so you need to find it modulo 109+7.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
The second line of each test case contains N−1 space separated integers - the ith of which is Bi​

Output Format
For each testcase(in a new line), output the count of valid possibilities of array A modulo 109+7.
