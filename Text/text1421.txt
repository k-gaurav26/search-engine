Problem
You are given an array A consisting of N Integers which are initially all 0. You are also given an array B consisting of N Integers. You have to tell whether you can make A equal to B or not by performing the following operation any number of times.
In one operation you can choose exactly K distinct indices in the array A and increase the value at these indices by 1.
Input:

First line will contain T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input.
First line contains two Integers N and K.
Second line contains N Integers denoting array B.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line YES if A can be converted to B, otherwise print NO.
