Chef has a machine which he uses to rotate sequences. If he puts a sequence S1​,S2​,…,SN​ into the machine, it produces the sequence S2​,S3​,…,SN​,S1​, i.e. the first element of the sequence is moved to the end.
Chef is definitely not a newbie ― he knows about trivial things like finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence. Therefore, he now made a difficult problem to challenge himself:
You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. For each k (0≤k≤N−1), consider the sequence produced by inserting it into the machine repeatedly k times (i.e. inserting A into the machine and replacing A by the sequence it produces, k times); find the maximum sum of a non empty contiguous subsequence of this sequence.
However, to solve this problem, Chef needs the help of a pro. Solve it for him.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should denote the largest sum of a non empty contiguous subsequence of the sequence produced by the machine after i−1 repeated insertions.
