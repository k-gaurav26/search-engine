Problem
Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a string S with length N that contains only the 26 lowercase English letters. You are also given a sequence W1​,W2​,…,W26​ of weights corresponding to these letters in the order from 'a' to 'z', i.e. W1​ is the weight of 'a', W2​ is the weight of 'b' and so on.
We define the weight of a string as the sum of weights of all characters present in it. If a character occurs multiple times in this string, its weight is also counted multiple times.
Next, we define the power of a string s as the sum of weights of all strings r such that s can be represented as r+r+…+r+p, where + denotes string concatenation and p is a prefix of r (possibly empty).
Consider a contiguous substring of S chosen uniformly randomly among all its N(N+1)/2 contiguous substrings. Find the expected value of the power of such a substring. The expected power can be represented as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should calculate P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string S.
The second line contains 26 space-separated integers W1​,W2​,…,W26​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353.
