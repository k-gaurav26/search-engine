Every Friday Chef and his N - 1 friends go for a party. At these parties, they play board games. This Friday, they are playing a game named "Boats! Boats! Boats!". In this game players have to transport cookies between Venice and Constantinople. Each player has a personal storage. The players are numbered from 1 to N, Chef is numbered 1. Rules for determining a winner are very difficult, therefore Chef asks you to write a program, which will determine who is a winner. 


There are 6 types of cookies. For each cookie in the storage player gets 1 point. Also player gets additional points if he packs his cookies in some boxes as follows: 
A box containing 4 different types of cookies fetches 1 additional point.
A box containing 5 different types of cookies fetches 2 additional points.
A box containing 6 different types of cookies fetches 4 additional points.
