Chef had three sequences of real numbers k1​,k2​,…,kN​, c1​,c2​,…,cN​ and x1​,x2​,…,xN​. Unfortunately, he lost the sequence x; the only thing he remembers about it is that
x1​⋅k1​+x2​⋅k2​+…+xN​⋅kN​=0.
Chef's favourite expression is
x1​+c1​​+x2​+c2​​+…+xN​+cN​​.
Its value is defined only if xi​+ci​≥0 for each valid i. Let's denote the maximum value of this expression (over all sequences x such that it is defined) by F.
Help Chef find F and a sequence x1​,x2​,…,xN​ such that the value of Chef's expression is F, or determine that there is no solution (the value of Chef's expression is always undefined).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N real numbers k1​,k2​,…,kN​.
The third line contains N real numbers c1​,c2​,…,cN​.

All real numbers are given with exactly two digits after the decimal point.
Output
For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single line containing one integer −1. Otherwise, print a single line containing N+1 space-separated real numbers F,x1​,x2​,…,xN​.
It can be proved that if a solution exists, then it is unique. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of each number on the output does not exceed 10−2.
