Polo, the Penguin, likes the XOR operation. Please read NOTE if you are not familiar with XOR operation. 
XOR-sum of a list of numbers is the result of XOR-ing all of them. XOR-sum of (A[1] XOR A[2] XOR ... XOR A[N]) is defined as A[1] XOR (A[2] XOR (A[3] XOR ( ... XOR A[N]))).
Apart of that, Polo, the Penguin, likes trees. He has a weighted tree consisting of N vertices.
He also likes to choose some pair of vertices U and V and find XOR-sum of all weights on the simple path from U to V. Help him to find the maximal number he can get .
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of vertices in the tree. The next N-1 lines contain description of edges of the tree, one edge per line in format U[i] V[i] W[i], where U[i] and V[i] are the indices of the vertices of edge and W[i] is the weight of the edge. Vertices are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.Â
