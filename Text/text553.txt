Problem
Chef is given a binary string S of length N. As Chef loves 1010 and he is busy in the preparation of Christmas, he asks you to count the maximum number of continuous substrings 1010, which Chef can get after reordering symbols in the given string.
As a reminder, a binary string is a string consisting only of 0's ans 1's.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of the test case contains an integer N - the length of the binary string.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string S.

Output Format
For each test case, print maximum number of continuous substrings 1010, which Chef can get after reordering symbols in the string.
