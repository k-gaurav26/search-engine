There are N circles in a plane. Circle i and circle j form a good pair if it is possible to choose a point P1​ on the perimeter of circle i and a point P2​ on the perimeter of circle j such that the Euclidean distance between P1​ and P2​ is exactly K. (Note that P1​ and P2​ do not need to have integer coordinates.)
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given the required distance K. Chef is interested in finding the number of good pairs of distinct circles for each query. Please help him.
Note: Circle i and circle j are distinct when i=j. There may be any number of circles that coincide (have identical centers and radii).
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q denoting the number of circles and the number of queries respectively.
Each of the following N lines contains three space-separated integers X, Y and R describing a circle with radius R and center (X,Y).
Each of the next Q lines contains one integer K describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good pairs of circles.
