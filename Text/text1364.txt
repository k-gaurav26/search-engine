A directed tree is a directed graph such that if all edges were undirected, this graph would be a tree. A rooted directed tree is a directed tree in which there is one vertex (the root, let's denote it by r) such that it is possible to reach all vertices of the graph from r by moving along the directed edges.
You are given a directed tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). You may perform the following operation on it any number of times (including zero):

Choose some edge which currently exists in the graph.
Remove this edge.
Add a new edge in such a way that the graph becomes a directed tree again.

What is the smallest number of operations which need to be performed in order to make the directed tree rooted?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that there is a directed edge from u to v in the tree.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations we need to perform to create a rooted directed tree.
