Chef has n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an. He defined the following function 
f(k) = (a1k + a2k + ... + ank) mod (109 + 7) over them.


Chef knows the values f(1), f(2), ..., f(n), but he has forgotten the values a1, a2, ..., an.


Now Chef wants to evaluate the function f over some integers (total Q  of them), can you please help him in this?

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of three lines.
The first line contains two space separated integers n and Q.
The second line contains n space separated integers - the values of f(1), f(2), ..., f(n).
The third line contains Q space separated integers x1, x2, ..., xq, where xi denotes the number in the i-th query.
Output

For each test case, print a single line containing Q space separate integers denoting  the values of f(x1), f(x2), ..., f(xq).
