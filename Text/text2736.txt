Problem
 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian 
Chef is exploring a new mathematical problem, which can be stated as follows:




where [x] means greatest integer which doesn't exceed x.


Chef wants you to answer some questions for a given pair of integers N, K: 
What is the   least common multiple of F(N, 1), F(N, 2), ... , F(N, K) modulo 109 + 7.

Chef is not willing to give you all queries at once. Instead, he gives you the first query and suggests you generate all the following queries in this way:

Ni = 1 + (A * Answeri-1 + Ci) mod M ,
Ki = 1 + (B * Answeri-1 + Di) mod Ni, 
where Answeri is the answer for the ith query.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of questions Chef wants to ask you. 
Second line contains two space-separated integers N1, K1.
Third line contains three space-separated integers A, B, and M, described in the statement.
Next line contains T-1 space-separated integers: C2, C3, ... , CT
Next line contains T-1 space-separated integers: D2, D3, ... , DT

Output

For each test case, output a single integer â€” the answer for the given query.
