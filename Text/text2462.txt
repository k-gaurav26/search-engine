Chef has a string S with length N. As Chef really likes his name, he defines the chefness of a string as the number of ways to find the string "chef" as a subsequence in S; formally, it's the number of ways to choose four indices i, j, k, l such that Si = 'c', Sj = 'h', Sk = 'e', Sl = 'f' and 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k ≤ l ≤ N. For example, the chefness of "chehefc" is 3 (with subsequences given by indices (1, 2, 3, 6), (1, 2, 5, 6), (1, 4, 5, 6)).
Chef perfectly understands that people really don't like strings with chefness greater than K. Therefore, he wants to erase a number of characters (possibly zero) from S in order to obtain a string with chefness equal to K. Help him compute the minimum number of characters he has to erase in order to achieve that!
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains a string S with length N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of characters that need to be erased from S in order to obtain a string with chefness K, or -1 if it's impossible.
