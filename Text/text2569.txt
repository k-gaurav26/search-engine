Problem
Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given three integers N, K and X. Is it possible to find a sequence of non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ such that the number of pairs of indices (i,j) (1≤i≤j≤N) satisfying Ai​⊕Aj​=X is equal to K? Here, ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and X.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find a sequence satisfying the given condition or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).
